# Changelog

All notable changes to `cboxdk/laravel-telemetry` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Duplicate OTLP log for a reported exception.** `report()` runs the
  package's structured exception instrumentation first (the `exception`
  OTLP log with `exception.file`/`.line`/`.stacktrace`/`.group`), then
  continues to Laravel's own default logger — and when the `telemetry`
  channel rides in `LOG_STACK`, that trailing pass shipped a second, less
  structured `ERROR <message>` record for the same throwable.

  The telemetry log channel now recognises that trailing pass and skips
  only it. Identity is the throwable object itself (a one-shot `WeakMap`
  mark set by the exception instrumentation) plus a message match against
  `$e->getMessage()` — exactly the shape of Laravel's default-logger call —
  so two exceptions that share class + message + stack stay independent,
  and an explicit `Log::error('caught', ['exception' => $e])` that was
  never `report()`ed still ships. The mark is consumed by the skip and
  dropped by `resetContext()` between Octane requests and queue jobs.
  Laravel's reporting chain, other reportable callbacks and other Monolog
  handlers are untouched.

- **Duplicate structured exception log under Laravel + Collision console
  boot.** `CollisionServiceProvider` resolves the framework exception
  handler and then REBINDS the `ExceptionHandler` contract to an adapter
  wrapping that same instance. The container re-fires the package's
  `afterResolving` callback for the adapter too, and Collision's adapter
  delegates `reportable()` straight through to the wrapped handler — so
  a single `report()` previously emitted two `ERROR exception` OTLP
  records on every artisan boot (queue workers, scheduled commands, and
  `tinker` included).

  Exception-reportable arming is now idempotent per handler instance. The
  callback arms only on the framework exception handler
  (`Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\Handler`), not on adapters/proxies,
  and a `WeakMap` identity guard prevents the same instance arming twice
  when it is resolved/rebound directly — the same shape the package's own
  Gate instrumentation already uses. **Compatibility:** custom non-framework
  `ExceptionHandler` contract implementations that expose `reportable()`
  but do not extend the framework `Handler` are no longer instrumented.
  This was never documented or tested; framework extension is the
  supported path.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **predis is no longer timed, because there is nothing to time yet.**
  `PredisConnector::connect()` returns `new Client(...)`, and predis's
  constructor only assembles objects — the socket opens on the first
  command. `redis.connect` therefore reported the handshake as a few
  microseconds of object construction, which is worse than no span: it rules
  out a slow connect that may be exactly what is wrong. Only phpredis, whose
  `connect()` does open the socket, is timed now; a custom creator is left
  alone for the same reason, since we cannot know whether it connects
  eagerly.

- **The connection decorators honour the master switch.** With
  `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` both were installed anyway, so every database
  query resolved `TelemetryManager` — its registry, resource detection and
  configured exporters — only to discard the observation, breaking the
  zero-cost-when-disabled invariant. The check now lives inside the binding
  closure, as the `Tracer` binding's does, so it reads config at resolution
  rather than at registration and hands back the framework's own
  `ConnectionFactory` when telemetry is off.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **`Redis::shouldReceive()` works again.** `InstrumentedRedisManager` and
  `InstrumentedConnectionFactory` were marked `final`. They replace the
  `redis` and `db.factory` bindings, and a facade mock mocks the bound
  instance's class — so Mockery refused, and every test in a consuming app
  that mocks the Redis facade failed with "marked final and its methods
  cannot be replaced". It surfaced in a host application's health-check
  test, which has nothing to do with telemetry.

  Both are now open, as `InstrumentedFilesystemManager` already was for the
  same reason (and as Laravel's own `RedisManager` and `ConnectionFactory`
  are). There is a test for it now, so it cannot regress quietly.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **`db.connect` and `redis.connect` spans, plus a
  `db.client.connection.create_time` histogram.** Laravel's `QueryExecuted`
  and `CommandExecuted` events fire only once a connection is already up, so
  the handshake — DNS, TCP, TLS, auth — was invisible: a database that
  answers every query in a millisecond but blocks for thirty seconds on
  connect showed up as an unexplained gap in the waterfall before the first
  query, with nothing to attribute it to.

  PDO is resolved lazily, so the timing wraps the resolver closure rather
  than `ConnectionFactory::make()` (which returns before any socket opens).
  That also makes it cheap: one span per connection per request, not one per
  query. `InstrumentedConnectionFactory` defers to the parent for building
  the resolver, so read/write splits and the multi-host failover loop are
  unchanged.

  The spans are deliberately not detail-marked — a connect is rare and
  high-signal, so it survives `traces.details.mode=tail` trimming. A connect
  that throws is recorded and then rethrown unchanged.

  Redis is decorated through `extend()` rather than a rebinding, because
  Laravel's `RedisServiceProvider` is deferred and would otherwise register
  after this package and overwrite it. Telemetry's own store and spool
  connections are always skipped: a span about opening the spool would be
  written into the spool.

  Both default to on; `TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENT_DB_CONNECT=false` and
  `TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENT_REDIS_CONNECT=false` turn them off.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **`laravel.routing` no longer includes the instrument's own startup.**
  The phase boundary opened before the middleware had finished arming
  itself, so opening the span, adopting the native unit, starting the
  sampler and taking the first resource sample were all measured as the
  application's route resolution. On one Hubhus request `laravel.routing`
  reported 29 ms while matching against 2697 uncached routes took 0.03 ms
  — the rest was this middleware. The size varies by platform (on macOS
  the resource sample shells out to `lsof`; Linux reads `/proc/{pid}`),
  but the mis-attribution did not: the trace read as though the app's
  route table were slow, and there was nothing there to optimise.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Request phases.** The request span now splits into `laravel.routing`,
  `laravel.middleware`, `laravel.handler`, `laravel.send` and
  `laravel.terminate`, with a matching `<phase>_ms` tally on the request
  span. The waterfall shows whether time went to the route's middleware
  stack, to the controller and its views, to sending the response, or to
  work after it. See
  [Request phases](docs/core-concepts/traces.md#request-phases).

- **Which controller answered.** The request span carries `code.namespace`
  and `code.function` for the route's action. `http.route` says which URL
  pattern matched, which is not the same question — routes share
  controllers and one controller answers many routes, so a trace could
  show the path and the queries under it and nothing about the code in
  between. An invokable controller reports `__invoke`; a closure route
  gets `code.function` alone, because inventing a namespace for it gives a
  UI something false to group by. Both bounded by the route table.

  `laravel.middleware` comes from the same work: Laravel announces no
  event between the middleware stack ending and the controller starting,
  so the boundary comes from decorating the controller dispatcher
  `Route::run()` resolves from the container. A closure route, and a
  request a middleware answered itself, never reach that seam and fold
  into `laravel.handler` rather than reporting a middleware cost of zero.

### Fixed

- **`http.server.request.duration` no longer counts work after the
  response.** Laravel runs terminable middleware and `defer()` callbacks
  after the response has been sent, and the metric used to measure until
  they finished. A request that answered in 80 ms and deferred 2 s of work
  was recorded as a 2 s request. The metric now stops when the response is
  sent. **Latency dashboards and alerts will drop** for apps that defer
  work or do heavy session writes. The request span still covers the
  post-response work, now as `laravel.terminate`.

- **`laravel.bootstrap` no longer reports a worker's age as boot time.**
  The span measured from `LARAVEL_START` on every request, but that
  constant is set once per process. On a long-lived runtime that defines
  it (NativePHP's persistent interpreter, a custom worker), every request
  in the first minute of a worker's life got a bootstrap span as long as
  the worker had been running. A 60-second cap hid it after that. The span
  is now recorded only for the first request a process serves, which is
  every request under FPM. An ignored first request consumes it as well.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Ignored request paths** — `instrument.http_ignore_paths`
  (`TELEMETRY_HTTP_IGNORE_PATHS`, comma-separated) and
  `Telemetry::ignorePaths([...])` for packages, merged. `Str::is()` globs
  on the path without its leading slash (`health`, `horizon*`,
  `telemetry-ui/*`).

  A dashboard mounted in the host app (cboxdk/laravel-telemetry-ui) was
  traced like any other traffic, so its own panel requests became the
  host's top routes. `Sample::never()` didn't help: it drops the spans but
  keeps the request metrics and the page view, and failing spans still
  escape it.

  A matching request gets no server span, no `http.server.*` metrics, no
  `analytics.page_view` and no `X-Trace-Id`. The tracer is suppressed for
  the request, so spans inside it (queries, outgoing HTTP, mail) are
  context only and never exported, error spans included. They don't start
  orphan traces, and no trace context propagates to jobs or downstream
  services. Exceptions are still recorded as `exception` records and
  counted in `exceptions.reported`, without a trace id. Also adds
  `Telemetry::ignoredPaths()`, `Telemetry::ignoresPath()` and
  `Tracer::suppress()`.

- **The package now ignores its own routes** (`instrument.http_ignore_own_routes`,
  on by default). The Prometheus scrape endpoints, the browser span ingest,
  its RUM asset and the source map upload were instrumented as ordinary app
  traffic: a 15-second scrape is ~5,700 requests a day that measure nothing
  about the app and land near the top of the host's own route tables, and
  the ingest route fires once per real page view — telemetry reporting
  itself as traffic. Prometheus already records `scrape_duration_seconds`
  per target, from the side that can act on it.

  The exclusion is registered from the path each route is actually
  configured with, so moving an endpoint moves it too, and it is read when
  a request arrives rather than resolved during boot. Set the flag to
  `false` to measure them like any other route.

  Laravel's `/up` is deliberately **not** excluded: it is the host's route,
  and silently dropping traffic an installation already records is worse
  than the noise. `http_ignore_paths` stays `[]` by default — the config
  file now says so, and where to add `up` if you want it gone.

### Fixed

- **Two ways a metric-inspection assertion could pass for the wrong
  reason** (`Testing\RecordedMetrics`, added in 2.4.0). Both are the silent
  pass the object exists to remove, so both now fail:

  - `assertCardinalityBelow()` and `assertLabelCardinalityBelow()` passed on
    a metric that recorded **nothing at all** — a budget of 50 on 0 series
    holds, which is exactly what a test whose instrumentation never ran
    looks like. Assert an absence deliberately with `assertSeriesCount(0)`
    or `assertCounterNotIncremented()`.
  - `assertLabelValues()` ignored series that do not carry the label,
    so "exactly these stage values" passed while other series had no
    `stage` at all. It now fails, naming how many series are unlabelled and
    showing the first few; scope the set with `withLabels()` or `filter()`
    when a label really is optional.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Metric inspection in `Telemetry::fake()`** — `recordedMetrics()`, the
  metric counterpart to `recordedSpans()`/`recordedEvents()`.

  The label assertions only ever answered *does this series exist?*, which
  is the wrong question when a label value is itself under test: code that
  attributes a counter across several branches produces a valid value on
  every one of them, so a test that checks one branch — or checks
  membership of the vocabulary — passes while the rest are dead.

  `$fake->recordedMetrics('transit.pairs')` returns every recorded series
  (`RecordedSample`: name, type, labels, value, histogram count/sum) as a
  filterable, iterable `RecordedMetrics` set with
  `labelValues()`, `labelSets()`, `labelCardinality()`, `seriesCount()`,
  `total()`, `forMetric()`, `ofType()`, `withLabels()` and `filter()`.

  Assertions chain: `assertLabelValues($label, $values)` pins the *full*
  observed set of one label, and `assertCardinalityBelow()`,
  `assertLabelCardinalityBelow()` and `assertSeriesCount()` put a budget on
  cardinality — a blown budget names the label that blew it.
  `$fake->metricLabelValues()`/`assertMetricLabelValues()` are the
  one-metric shorthands.

### Fixed

- `Telemetry::fake()`'s metric assertions now see metrics published by a
  registered `TelemetryProvider`: they collect through `collect()` (which
  boots pending providers) instead of reading the store directly.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- **Support for [`cboxdk/telemetry-native`](https://github.com/cboxdk/telemetry-native)**,
  the optional `cbox_telemetry` extension — the three things PHP cannot
  measure about itself, with this package still owning every semantic.

  Requests, jobs, commands and scheduled tasks are bracketed as native units
  of work. From each one: a CPU profile for the slow ones (the same
  `profiling.min_duration_ms` tail threshold, now carrying the sampling
  period, clock and a `profile.confidence` figure — ticks the kernel never
  delivered, samples the VM could only take late, and samples with nowhere
  to go are reported rather than averaged away), exact
  `pdo.connect`/`redis.connect`/`curl.exec` timing as span attributes plus
  `runtime.operations` and `runtime.operation.duration` metrics, and
  `php.gc.runs`/`php.gc.collected`.

  Crash records are drained by `telemetry:flush` (or the new
  `telemetry:crashes`) and reported as FATAL `crash.recorded` events
  carrying the trace and span id the process died in — a correlated OTLP log
  record, so the crash sits with that trace's logs next to the operation
  that was open at the time. Schedule `telemetry:crashes` per host: the
  records are files on the machine that crashed, and each uid has its own
  sink.

  Units do not nest, and Laravel makes nesting easy to trigger by accident,
  so the outermost unit wins: a sync job inside a request opens nothing.
  Commands that host their own units (`queue:work`, `horizon*`, `octane:*`,
  `schedule:run`, …) open none themselves, leaving the boundary to the jobs
  and tasks inside them.

  Where both are installed, the native profiler replaces `ext-excimer` —
  two samplers running at once mostly measure each other. The test is
  whether the native sampler is actually running, not whether a unit was
  obtained: a unit opens even where profiling is unavailable, so excimer
  still runs on a host that has the extension but no usable timer. Without either
  extension nothing changes, and `telemetry:doctor` now reports which is
  active, which operation hooks the extension actually installed, and what
  the crash recorder is doing. `Testing\FakeNativeRuntime` makes both paths
  testable on a machine without the extension.

### Fixed

- **A queue attempt that reported no outcome leaked its span for the life of
  the worker.** `Worker::handleJobException` dispatches
  `JobReleasedAfterException` only for a job it released itself, so a job that
  calls `$this->release()` and *then* throws produces none of the four events
  this package closes an attempt on. Its span stayed on the tracer's context
  stack: later spans were parented to a job that had long finished, and the
  shutdown path ended it as an error that lasted until the process died.

  Closed on `JobAttempted`, which Laravel dispatches in a `finally` for every
  attempt. The span is ENDED rather than discarded — the job ran and threw,
  and that is the trace worth having — with `queue.job.outcome = abandoned`
  and an error status. No `queue.jobs.*` counter moves for it: the framework
  reported no outcome, and folding these into `released` would put attempts it
  never called released into the series alerts are built on.

- **Config switches written as `0` or `1` in `.env` were ignored.** Laravel's
  `env()` converts `true`, `false`, `null` and `empty` to PHP values and leaves
  everything else a string, so `TELEMETRY_OTLP_COMPRESSION=0` reached config as
  the string `"0"` — which the strict boolean reader rejected as "not a bool"
  and answered with the default. The switch then did the opposite of what the
  `.env` file said, silently, and only for the numeric spelling. Config flags
  are now read with `Cast::flag()`, which accepts what a `.env` file can
  actually produce. Affects `otlp.compression` and every `telemetry.native.*`
  switch.

- **The shutdown flush added in 2.2.1 had no test that could fail without it.**
  `FatalErrorFlushTest` calls `flushOnShutdown()` directly, which never runs the
  callback that method registers — so the fix shipped unproven. A subprocess
  test now exercises PHP's real shutdown ordering and fails without it.

  Its comment also promised more than PHP does. A function registered during
  shutdown is APPENDED to the current queue, so it runs after everything
  already in it; it does not reserve the final position. A callback that itself
  registers another one to do the awaiting still lands behind the flush, and an
  `exit()` earlier in the queue stops it running at all. Both leave the call
  buffered, as they did before — now said plainly rather than implied away.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **A cancelled outgoing call was retained instead of collected.** 2.2.0 kept
  every outstanding detached span in a map so the shutdown path could close
  one whose promise was cancelled or never settled. Nothing else references a
  cancelled call's span, so the map was the only thing keeping it alive: 30,000
  cancellations retained about 26MB where the garbage collector had been
  freeing them. A request, job or Octane context reset released it; a daemon or
  a long-running command without those resets did not.

- **Shutdown ended calls that were still going to succeed.** `flushOnShutdown`
  runs on every request, and is registered before the callbacks an application
  adds to await its own outstanding work — so a call that went on to return 200
  was exported as an error lasting a third of a millisecond, and its real
  completion could no longer update or export it.

  Both are gone with the tracking. An abandoned call now leaves no span, which
  is what the instrumentation has always said it prefers: a missing span is the
  lesser evil, a span with the wrong duration and status is a lie that reads as
  data.

- **A detached span mixed the context it started in with the one it ended in.**
  Taking the ambient dimensions at creation protected the keys already on the
  span, but the merge at completion still ADDED keys that appeared in between,
  so a call begun under one tenant carried the next tenant's user. A snapshot
  is all of it or none.

- **A call that completed during shutdown was buffered and never sent.** An
  application that awaits its own outstanding HTTP work in a shutdown callback
  registers that callback after the package's, so it runs later — and a call
  that completed there had nothing left to flush it. A second flush is
  registered from inside the first, which PHP appends to the queue and
  therefore runs after those callbacks.

- **A rewrite that changed only the verb was skipped.** The correction compared
  the NORMALISED method, and two different verbs can normalise alike —
  `PROPFIND` and `REPORT` are both `_OTHER`, `get` and `GET` are both `GET` —
  so the previous verb was left standing in `http.request.method_original`.
  The original now takes part in the comparison.

- **A canonical method left an empty `http.request.method_original` behind.**
  `HttpMethod::original()` returns null for a canonical verb, and a null
  attribute is not an absence: it reaches the exporter as an empty string. It
  is removed now, through the new `Span::forgetAttribute()`.

- **The span name could disagree with its own method attribute.** When a
  `withRequestMiddleware()` callback rewrote the verb as well as the URI, the
  name was corrected from the sent request while `http.request.method` and the
  duration label kept the original — and a callback that rewrote only the verb
  was not corrected at all.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **Outgoing HTTP spans are owned by the Guzzle call instead of paired from
  events.** Laravel dispatches `RequestSending` from a middleware INSIDE
  Guzzle's redirect middleware, so it fires once per hop, while
  `ResponseReceived` fires once per CALL — and nothing on either event says
  which call a hop belongs to. A listener therefore had to pair them by request
  identity, which a redirect breaks: every hop but the last stayed open, and
  `Http::pool` interleaves hops with other members, so no "continue the span
  that is open" rule can pick the right one either. (Verified: a global Guzzle
  middleware does see `__redirect_count`, but an options key set there does not
  survive back up through the redirect middleware.)

  A middleware now wraps ONE hop: it opens a span, calls the handler below it,
  and closes that exact span when that hop's own promise settles. Nothing is
  matched, so nothing can be mismatched, and a redirect is simply two hops that
  each open and close.

  The span is DETACHED — it never becomes the ambient context. That also fixes
  a second defect: an ambient client span made every pooled request a CHILD of
  the one dispatched before it, and re-parented whatever ran next onto a call
  that had not finished.

  Two behaviours change for anyone who reached into the ambient context around
  an HTTP call. A `beforeSending` callback calling `Telemetry::currentSpan()`
  used to annotate the client span and now annotates the span the call was made
  from — the client span is no longer ambient, deliberately, because several
  can be open at once. And a call created under one set of context dimensions
  now keeps THOSE: the ambient dimensions are snapshotted when the span starts
  rather than merged when it ends, so an async call built under one tenant and
  settled under another is no longer attributed to the second.

  Consequences worth knowing. `http.client.request.duration` now observes once
  per HOP, so a call that followed two redirects records three; that is what
  the metric always claimed to measure. Each hop reads its own transfer timings
  — Laravel only keeps the last hop's on the response, so this is the only
  place an earlier hop could get them. And instrumentation now follows the
  container's HTTP `Factory`, so a hand-constructed `Factory` is no longer
  covered; `Http::` and everything resolved from the container is.

  `Cbox\Telemetry\Instrumentation\HttpClientInstrumentation` is removed. It
  held the per-request state that this replaces.

### Added

- **Client spans break their duration into transfer phases.** A span saying an
  outgoing call took 284ms does not say whether that was DNS, connection setup,
  waiting on the far end, or the response coming back down — and those have
  entirely different fixes. `http.client.dns_ms`, `.tcp_ms`, `.tls_ms`,
  `.ttfb_ms` and `.transfer_ms` now say which, alongside
  `network.peer.address`, `network.peer.port` and `network.protocol.version`.

  Needs no extension and nothing to wire: Laravel's HTTP client already
  installs cURL's `on_stats` callback and keeps the result on the response, so
  this reads what is there. Nothing is recorded when there was no cURL behind
  the response — a faked response, or the stream handler — because a row of
  zeroes reads as a transfer that did every phase instantly.

  What the intervals are, and are not. `ttfb_ms` runs from "about to transmit"
  to the first response headers cURL processes, so it INCLUDES sending the
  request body, and for a body large enough that Guzzle adds
  `Expect: 100-continue` it ends at the interim `100 Continue` rather than the
  real response — pushing the upload and the server's work into `transfer_ms`
  instead. `tls_ms` through an HTTP CONNECT proxy also contains the proxy
  tunnel negotiation, so a slow proxy reads as slow TLS. Over HTTP/3 there is
  no TCP handshake to time, so a single `http.client.connect_ms` replaces the
  TCP/TLS split rather than inventing one.

  A reused connection is reported as `http.client.connection_reused` with the
  connection phases absent, not as a DNS lookup that took no time. Plain HTTP
  gets no TLS phase. Guzzle follows redirects itself, so the phases describe
  the last hop while the span covers them all.

- **`Tracer::discardSpan()`.** A span an instrumentation abandons is removed
  from the context stack without being exported. Dropping a map alone was not
  enough: the spans stayed on the stack, where the shutdown path — registered
  with `register_shutdown_function`, so it runs on every request — ends
  everything still open as an error that lasted until the process died. A
  missing span is the lesser evil; a span with the wrong duration and status
  is a lie that reads as data. Applied to mail, notification, command and
  transaction spans abandoned at an Octane or NativePHP boundary; the HTTP
  client no longer needs it, per the ownership change above.

  Turn it off with `telemetry.instrument.http_client_timing`: collecting costs
  about a microsecond, but up to nine more attributes per client span are
  stored and run through redaction at flush.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-15

### Upgrading

- **Redaction lists are now UNIONED with the package's, not replaced by
  yours.** `mergeConfigFrom()` is a shallow `array_merge`, so a published
  `config/telemetry.php` replaced the package's `redaction` block whole and
  could never receive an entry added later — and the entries added later are
  the ones that catch newly-understood credential spellings. An app that
  published two versions ago was quietly less protected than one that never
  published at all. Rebuilding the config cache did not help.

  Nothing is required of you: `keys`, `patterns` and `safe_keys` you configure
  are added to the package's rather than replacing them, so an old published
  copy is covered as it stands. Tidying it up is still worth doing —

  ```php
  'keys'      => Redactor::defaultKeys(),
  'patterns'  => Redactor::defaultPatterns(),
  'safe_keys' => Redactor::defaultSafeKeys(),
  ```

  — and `telemetry:doctor` reports a copy that has drifted.

  **If you relied on your config REPLACING a built-in entry, set
  `redaction.replace_defaults` to `true`** (or `TELEMETRY_REDACTION_REPLACE_DEFAULTS=true`)
  to keep the old semantics. Prefer `safe_keys` or the custom hook for a single
  entry that gets in your way.

### Fixed

- **Credential query parameters escaped by how they were spelled.** `url.query`
  and the captured referer were scrubbed by pattern, over raw text — so
  `%74oken=`, `token%5B%5D=`, `access_token%5B0%5D=` and `token[name]=` went
  out with their values intact, and so did any credential that happened to be
  the FIRST parameter, because `url.query` carries no leading `?` for the
  pattern to anchor on. An OAuth callback puts the authorization code exactly
  there.

  Both are now taken apart and matched on the DECODED parameter name, which is
  the half a pattern cannot do without rewriting the value. Names ending in
  `_token`, `_secret`, `_password`, `_api_key`, `_signature` (and their `-` and
  `.` spellings, so `x-api-key` counts) match as a suffix; `key`, `auth`,
  `code`, `state`, `pwd`, `sig`, `jwt` and `otp` match exactly, so `sort_key`,
  `postal_code`, `token_count` and `signature_required` stay readable. The
  referer's path and fragment are left as they were.

- **A credential value ended at the wrong character.** The export pattern ran a
  value to the next `;` or quote, so `access_token=abc;more` and
  `password=abc'SECRET` published everything past that character, and a single
  optional quote could not get past a doubled one, so `access_token=""SECRET`
  matched nothing at all. A value now runs to the next `&` or to whitespace and
  nothing else ends it — which is also how PHP reads a query, where
  `arg_separator.input` is `&` and a `;` is an ordinary character.

- **A short `Basic`/`Bearer` credential survived in messages, and a
  `WWW-Authenticate` challenge did not.** The pattern wanted sixteen
  characters, so `Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz` — base64 for `user:pass`, twelve
  characters — went out verbatim, while `Bearer error=invalid_token` counted as
  nineteen characters of credential and was blanked. It now matches from four
  characters when one of them is neither a lowercase letter nor the first
  character, and `=` counts only as trailing base64 padding. `YTpi`, `abc123`
  and `dXNlcjpwYXNz` go; `Authentication`, `realm=api` and
  `error=insufficient_scope` stay. Predates 2.0.0.

- **A credential in a JSON context value was exported whole.** The log channel
  `json_encode`s any non-scalar context, so `['password' => 'hunter2']` arrived
  as `{"password":"hunter2"}` under a key like `log.context.payload` — a name
  that is not itself sensitive, around a body carrying no `name=value` pairs
  for a pattern to match. The structure is now redacted by key BEFORE it is
  encoded, where it is still an array. Deliberately not by decoding the JSON
  again at export: a round trip through `json_decode(..., true)` cannot tell an
  empty object from an empty array, turns `{"0":"a","1":"b"}` into a list, and
  rewrites big integers and float literals — corrupting structures that had
  nothing in them to redact.

- **Span LINK attributes were never scrubbed.** A link's attributes reach the
  exporter like any others — a retried job's link to its previous attempt
  carries whatever the app put on it — and were the one set redaction never
  walked. Predates 2.0.0.

- **Span names and span event names were never scrubbed.** `Telemetry::span()`
  and `nameRequestSpansUsing()` take whatever the app hands them, and a name
  built from a URL carries its query along — so the same credential went out
  redacted in the attributes and verbatim in the name beside them. Log record
  names were already covered; these were the gap.

- **A value that merely began with the replacement was taken as already
  redacted.** `token=[REDACTED]SECRET` passed through untouched, and an empty
  `replacement` matched everywhere, silently turning the parameter pass off
  altogether. The comparison now needs a real boundary after it, is bounded to
  the replacement's length rather than copying the rest of the input — which
  made it quadratic, 640KB of `token=x&` taking 349ms — and an empty
  replacement is no longer evidence of anything.

- **An ordinary assignment hid a credential inside its own value.** In a
  logfmt-style message, `url=https://x/?token=SECRET` matched as the parameter
  `url`, was judged harmless, and the query inside it was consumed with it. A
  value carrying a `?` is now looked into. Parameter names are also no longer
  capped at 64 characters, which silently exempted a long array name.

- **A parameter name full of unclosed brackets could stall the process.** The
  regex that stripped array levels was quadratic on `token[[[[[…]tail` — 20k
  brackets took 67ms, 200k over a second — and it raised no PCRE error, so the
  fail-closed guard never saw it. Reachable from a query string. The root name
  is now taken by truncating at the first bracket, which is linear and means
  the same thing. Introduced in this release, never shipped.

- **`safe_keys` are no longer unioned with the package's.** `keys` and
  `patterns` are rules, so adding the package's can only redact more;
  `safe_keys` are EXEMPTIONS, and adding those back would re-expose what an app
  deliberately stopped exempting. An app that narrows `safe_keys` keeps it
  narrowed.

- **A credential parameter written any way but literally escaped every
  attribute except the two that are parsed.** `url.query` and the referer are
  taken apart at capture, but an exception message quoting the same URL was
  only ever pattern-matched, so `GET https://x/?%74oken=SECRET failed` and
  `token[name]=SECRET` went out intact. Every attribute value now gets a pass
  that matches on the DECODED parameter name — the name, never the value,
  because decoding the value would publish something the caller never sent.
  `key`, `auth`, `code`, `state` and `pwd` still need a real query context —
  `pwd=/srv/app` is a working directory in any shell-flavoured log — while
  `sig`, `jwt` and `otp` are credentials wherever they appear, and are now
  attribute keys in their own right so `log.context.otp` is covered too.

  The two query-parameter patterns this replaces are gone from
  `defaultPatterns()`. They could not see an encoded name, and a second pass
  over a value they had already replaced re-matched it — appending its own tail
  each time, for any `replacement` containing a space. The new pass is
  idempotent and takes a quoted value whole, so a password with a space in it
  no longer publishes the rest of itself. `replace_defaults` turns it off with
  the lists, since it is a built-in rule like the others.

- **An exception mapper lost the failed job's dimensions.** `Handler::map()`
  replaces the throwable before the reportable callbacks run, so the snapshot
  keyed to the original was never found. The `previous` chain is now walked,
  bounded, which is where Laravel's own mappers leave the original.

### Added

- **`telemetry:doctor` reports a published config that copied the redaction
  lists** instead of referencing `Redactor::defaultPatterns()` and friends. It
  names how many entries are missing. See the upgrading note above — this is
  the failure that has no other symptom.


- **`http.request.method` was an unbounded metric label.** It carried the
  method from the request line — whatever the caller sent, with nothing
  restricting it to a real verb. Unmatched requests are measured too, so
  anyone could mint permanent series from outside the app without
  authenticating or hitting a route. An app could not fix it for itself:
  core labels win over `labelRequestsUsing()`.

  semconv covers this — an unknown method reports `_OTHER`, the original
  goes on the span as `http.request.method_original`, and the span NAME uses
  `HTTP` rather than the raw method, since a name is caller-controlled
  otherwise and anything deriving a dimension from names inherits the same
  unbounded set. Applied at every site the attribute appears: server span and
  name, server metric, analytics page-view event, outgoing client span, name
  and metric.

  The nine semconv names are not every real method (WebDAV alone adds
  PROPFIND, MKCOL and REPORT), so the list is configurable via
  `instrument.known_http_methods` — an explicitly empty array is an override
  too, for an app that wants everything bucketed.

  **Upgrade note.** A method outside the list now lands in `_OTHER` and its
  span name starts `HTTP`. If you deliberately serve a non-semconv method,
  add it to `instrument.known_http_methods` before upgrading or its history
  will split.

- **Credentials in query strings survived redaction almost everywhere.**
  `url.query` was scrubbed by exact parameter name, so `api_token`,
  `accessToken`, `_token`, `token[]` and percent-encoded spellings all went
  out intact — and the same secret reached the exporter untouched through
  `http.request.header.referer` and any `exception.message` quoting a URL,
  neither of which that scrubbing ever saw.

  Fixed where it belongs: two default patterns in `Redactor`, the one choke
  point every attribute value passes through, so one rule covers the query
  string, the referer, exception messages and log lines alike. Words that are
  always credentials match loosely; `code`, `state`, `key` and `auth` match
  exactly, because `?code=` on an OAuth callback is an authorization code
  while `postal_code=` is an address.

  Whitespace separates a parameter name as well as `?`, `&` and `;` do, so a
  credential quoted in prose — `Invalid api_token=sk_live_9` in an exception
  message, which is where an error report is most likely to carry one — is
  redacted too, not only one sitting in a query string. The credential word
  still has to end the name, immediately before the `=`, which is what keeps
  `token_count=`, `signature_required=` and `secret_count=` intact.

- **A failed job's error record could not say whose it was.** A queue worker
  tears the job down before it reports: Laravel dispatches `JobFailed` — or
  `JobReleasedAfterException`, which is every attempt but the last wherever
  retries are configured — from inside `Worker::handleJobException()` and only rethrows
  afterwards, so the exception reaches the handler in `Worker::runJob()`'s
  catch with the job's context already gone.

  The dimensions are now snapshotted at that teardown and merged into the
  error event by the reportable listener. The snapshot is keyed to the
  throwable in a `WeakMap`, so it can only ever reach the exception it was
  taken for, and nothing has to clear it — an entry the handler never claims
  dies with the exception rather than waiting to be mistaken for someone
  else's. Live context still wins; this only supplies what is missing.
  Deliberately a snapshot rather than keeping the context alive: alive means
  every later span, log, event and outgoing `baggage` header in that worker
  process inherits a dead job's tenant, including the worker's own lifetime
  span.

  On the released-for-retry half this depends on the framework: Laravel only
  put the throwable on `JobReleasedAfterException` in v13.31.0, so on 12.x and
  on 13.0–13.30 a released attempt has no throwable to key the snapshot to and
  keeps reporting unattributed. The listener coalesces rather than testing the
  version, so nothing breaks on the versions without it. `JobFailed` — the
  terminal failure, and the one that matters most — carries its exception on
  every supported version and is unaffected.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Two metric labels that anyone could grow without limit are bounded.**

  `schedule.task.duration`, `schedule.tasks.*` — the `task` label was
  `getSummaryForDisplay()`, which without an explicit description is the whole
  built command line: every argument, plus the output redirection. The
  arguments are exactly what varies, so
  `$schedule->command('reports:send --date='.now()->toDateString())` minted a
  new label value EVERY DAY, and the per-tenant pattern
  `foreach ($tenants as $t) { $schedule->command("tenant:sync {$t->id}") }`
  minted one per tenant — 15 histogram series plus three counters each, kept
  forever, with label values hundreds of bytes long. The label is now an
  explicit description if the app set one, otherwise the artisan command NAME
  with its arguments dropped.

  `worker.memory.php` / `worker.memory.rss` were GAUGES labelled by `pid`,
  retired only on `WorkerStopping` — which a worker killed by the OOM killer,
  SIGKILL or a container eviction never dispatches. So the metric designed to
  catch a leaking worker leaked a permanent series precisely when the worker
  died of the leak, each frozen at its last value with no TTL: a worker
  recycling every 90s across 20 queues left roughly 1,900 dead series a day.
  They are now HISTOGRAMS named `queue.worker.memory.{php,rss}` and labelled by
  queue. A distribution drifting upward over time is the leak signal; it is a
  weaker one than a per-pid line, and honestly so — one leaking worker among
  many can grow without moving p95, and the doubling buckets hide growth within
  a boundary. The trade is a signal that still works against one that stopped
  being trustworthy the moment a worker died badly. The bundled leak-curve panel
  is rewritten as a p95 by queue.

  They are RENAMED rather than changed in place: `collect()` returns gauges
  before histograms, so a stale v1 `worker.memory.*` gauge family — which
  `--wipe` does not remove, since it deliberately preserves meta and indexes —
  would have won the renderer's type conflict and hidden the new histogram
  indefinitely. The v1 series linger until the store is reset; nothing writes
  them any more.


### Fixed

- **Three ways the Prometheus renderer emitted invalid exposition.** What it
  costs differs per case, and they are called out individually below rather
  than under one blanket claim: a parse error is not scoped to the offending
  metric — the target goes `up=0` and every metric from the app disappears —
  while repeated metadata or a repeated series costs values, not the target.

  - *Duplicate label names.* Labels were merged on their RAW keys and sanitized
    afterwards, so a user label `host.name` — the dotted style the docs
    recommend — alongside the pre-sanitized `host_name` resource label rendered
    as `{host_name="web-1",host_name="db-3"}`. Merging now happens on the
    sanitized name.
  - *Duplicate family names.* Dedupe keyed on the OTel name, but the names
    WRITTEN are the Prometheus ones — and a family writes several: a histogram
    occupies `<name>`, `<name>_bucket`, `<name>_sum` and `<name>_count`, so a
    gauge called `payload.count` collides with a histogram called `payload`.
    A counter occupies `<name>_total` in the classic format and both `<name>`
    and `<name>_total` in OpenMetrics, so whether it collides with a
    same-named gauge depends on the format being rendered. `orders.created` and
    `orders_created` are two legal, distinct families that both render as
    `orders_created_total`, and both were emitted with their own
    `# HELP`/`# TYPE`. Dedupe now keys on the rendered name, which is also the
    one the render loop uses, so they cannot drift. (Repeated metadata for one
    name is invalid under both grammars and is rejected outright by a strict
    OpenMetrics parser; Prometheus' own text parser is more forgiving and
    updates its metadata cache instead, so on that path the cost is the wrong
    `# HELP`/`# TYPE` plus whatever duplicate series follow.)
  - *Duplicate samples.* Merging two same-name families concatenated their
    samples without deduplicating labelsets, so a stored push gauge and a
    cross-process observable sharing a name and a labelset produced two
    identical lines. One sample per labelset now wins. (Prometheus drops the
    duplicate and continues rather than failing the scrape, so this one cost a
    silently lost value — the family and label cases above take the target
    down.) This now runs for every family, not only when two are merged: a
    single family carrying both spellings of one labelset was never checked.

- **Prometheus rendering, four smaller correctness fixes.**

  - *Collision checking was quadratic.* Each family was intersected against
    the whole accumulated name list, so the cost grew with the square of the
    family count: 10 000 gauges measured 3.6 s against 19 ms after the fix —
    long enough to blow a scrape timeout on an app with many series.
  - *`By` and `bytes` were treated as different units.* Both suffix `_bytes`,
    so two such families render under one name, but the merge compared the raw
    unit strings, called them incompatible, and dropped the second family's
    samples entirely.
  - *Empty label values are absent labels.* Prometheus defines `foo{route=""}`
    and `foo` as the same series; emitting both lost one of the two values at
    ingestion. Empty values are now dropped before rendering.
  - *OpenMetrics reserves `_created`.* A counter or histogram may carry an
    optional `<name>_created` sample, so a gauge named `<name>.created` is a
    forbidden clash whether or not that sample is emitted. It now counts as a
    collision in OpenMetrics, and stays legal in classic text, which reserves
    nothing.

- **OpenMetrics counter family names no longer carry `_total`.** The spec puts
  that suffix on the SAMPLE, not the family, so `# TYPE foo_total counter`
  registered the metadata under a name no metric has — Prometheus' UI and
  metadata API showed none for `foo`, and strict consumers reject it. The
  `# UNIT` line is emitted too where the name carries a unit suffix, which makes
  the unit machine-readable rather than only implied by the name.


### Changed

- **Span attributes now use the OpenTelemetry names, not lookalikes.** The docs
  promise "exactly one canonical vocabulary"; three namespaces were not it.

  | Was | Now | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `enduser.id` / `.type` / `.guard` | `user.id` / `.type` / `.guard` | `enduser.*` was deprecated in semconv 1.27; collector processors and Tempo's user attribution key on `user.id` |
  | `client.geo.country` / `.region` / `.city` / `.continent.code` | `geo.country.iso_code` / `geo.region.iso_code` / `geo.locality.name` / `geo.continent.code` | `client.geo.*` is Elastic ECS naming; OTel's registry is the flat `geo.*` namespace, so nothing downstream recognised the old keys |
  | `db.namespace` = the Laravel connection | `laravel.db.connection` | semconv's `db.namespace` is the database/schema name; putting the connection there read as wrong data in Tempo's DB views. The Redis and transaction instrumentations used `db.connection` for the same concept — all three now agree |

  `geo.region.iso_code` is ISO 3166-2 (`US-CA`), built from the country and
  Cloudflare's `CF-Region-Code`. It previously carried `CF-Region`, which is the
  region NAME (`California`) — an iso_code attribute holding a name makes every
  region filter and geo join miss.

  **Upgrade note.** TraceQL queries, dashboards and collector processors keying
  on the old attribute names must be updated. The bundled Grafana suite is
  regenerated. Attributes an app supplies itself through `resolveUserUsing()`
  are untouched — only the names this package emits changed.


### Changed

- **`http.server.request.duration` and `http.client.request.duration` are now
  recorded in SECONDS**, on a ladder FINER than semconv's advisory one
  (`0.0005 … 10`, sixteen buckets). Both are stable semconv metrics whose unit the spec fixes to
  seconds; emitting them in milliseconds meant every stock dashboard and alert
  looking for `http_server_request_duration_seconds_bucket` found nothing,
  because this package produced `…_milliseconds_bucket` — and a collector fed
  these alongside any other OTel SDK saw one metric name arrive with two
  different units, which the Prometheus/Mimir OTLP receiver treats as a
  conflict. Reusing a semconv name with a non-semconv unit is the worst of both
  worlds.

  The unit is fixed by the spec; the buckets are only advisory. Semconv's
  advisory ladder starts at 5ms, which is COARSER at the low end than the
  millisecond ladder it replaces — so the buckets go finer instead, down to
  0.5ms. Conformance costs no resolution.

  **Upgrade note — this renames two Prometheus series.** Panels and alerts on
  `http_server_request_duration_milliseconds_*` or
  `http_client_request_duration_milliseconds_*` must move to
  `…_seconds_*`, and any threshold expressed in milliseconds must be divided by
  1000. Historical data keeps the old series name; the two do not join.

  Metrics whose names the spec does NOT define — `queue.job.duration`,
  `command.duration`, `schedule.task.duration`, `queue.job.wait_time`,
  `telemetry.export.duration`, the `screen.*` pair — are unchanged and stay in
  milliseconds. The unit travels in the Prometheus name either way, and there is
  no shared vocabulary to conform to.


### Fixed

- **Client spans are no longer left open when the framework hands back a
  different object.** Two instrumentations tracked their in-flight span by
  `spl_object_id()` of an object the framework does not promise to reuse:

  - A failed outgoing HTTP call arrives with a FRESH `Request` wrapper
    (`new Request($e->getRequest())` in
    `PendingRequest::marshalTransportException`), so the lookup missed on every
    connection failure.
  - `AbstractTransport::send()` does `$message = clone $message` on its first
    line and `SentMessage` keeps that clone as its "original", so the lookup
    missed on every *successful* mail send.

  In both cases the span was never ended and never exported — and because it
  stayed on the tracer stack, every later span in the request was parented under
  it. A failing dependency, or simply sending mail, quietly rewrote the shape of
  the whole trace.

  HTTP now keys on the PSR request, which the framework *does* preserve across
  both wrappers, so it stays exact even for concurrent `Http::pool()` calls to
  the same URL. Mail keys on the message and falls back to the innermost open
  send, because sends nest strictly and the inner one completes first.

  Neither guesses by what the call looks like. Some paths still go unmatched
  and leave that one span open until `flushRequestState()`: a redirect (one
  `ResponseReceived` for several `RequestSending`s), Guzzle's streaming handler
  cloning the request, and a `beforeSending` callback replacing it — that last
  on the exception path only, since success closes through the stored wrapper.
  Mail's fallback is a heuristic with a known boundary, documented at the call
  site. Leaving a span open is much the lesser evil against closing one with
  someone else's duration and status, which reads as data.

- **A fatal error now delivers its error record and its trace.** A fatal —
  `max_execution_time`, an allocation over `memory_limit`, an uncaught `Error` —
  never reaches `Kernel::terminate()`, so neither the terminating callback nor
  the request middleware's flush ever ran. Laravel's own shutdown handler *did*
  convert the fatal into a `FatalError` and push it through `report()`, which
  this package turns into an exception record — and that record then sat in the
  event buffer and died with the process, along with the still-open request
  span. So the one class of failure you most want an error tracker for produced
  nothing at all: no error, no trace, nothing. For anyone replacing Sentry with
  this, that was the hole.

  A `register_shutdown_function` now closes any spans left open (as errors, not
  as if they had completed) and flushes. It is registered after Laravel's own
  handler — the `HandleExceptions` bootstrapper runs long before providers boot,
  and shutdown functions run in registration order — so by the time it executes,
  the fatal has already been reported and is waiting in the buffer.

- **One job attempt is counted once.** Laravel dispatches BOTH `JobFailed` and
  `JobProcessed` for a single attempt on two ordinary paths: a job calling
  `$this->fail($e)` (`Job::fail()` dispatches `JobFailed`, `fire()` then returns
  normally and the worker raises `JobProcessed`), and a job arriving past
  `--tries` (`markJobAsFailedIfAlreadyExceedsMaxAttempts` fails it, then
  `if ($job->isDeleted()) return $this->raiseAfterJobEvent(…)`). Both were
  counted, so `queue.jobs.failed` and `queue.jobs.processed` each rose by one
  for the same attempt and every success-rate panel overstated success in
  proportion to the failure rate — the worse the day, the better it looked.

  The second call also popped the span stack again, which in a sync-inside-async
  dispatch ended the OUTER job's span early and recorded its duration against
  the inner job's outcome. Completion is now latched per attempt, in a `WeakMap`
  so a long-running worker neither grows an entry per job nor latches a later
  job through a reused `spl_object_id()`.

- **A partially failed metric flush no longer replays the writes that
  succeeded.** `BufferedMetricStore::flushBuffer()` cleared its buffer only
  after every write had landed, so a store throwing partway — a Redis blip on
  the third counter — left the earlier, successful writes in the buffer, and the
  next flush applied them a second time. In a long-running worker a write that
  keeps failing inflates its predecessors on every retry. Each series is now
  dropped as its write lands, making a partial flush exactly-once for what
  landed and leaving only the remainder to retry.

- **Metric bookkeeping repairs itself instead of disappearing until a
  restart.** `initialize()` memoized "done" per process *before* its writes, so
  one transient failure disabled initialization for the life of that process.
  Worse, the memo was permanent: the meta, `__since` and index entries live in
  Redis/APCu, which can lose them in ways this package does not control — a
  restart without persistence, a `FLUSHDB`, an eviction under `maxmemory`, or
  APCu expunging its whole cache when the segment fills. A warm process then
  kept writing data nobody could read, because `collect()` walks the index and
  drops any family whose meta is gone. The metric vanished from every scrape
  until a *cold* process happened to write it again — which, for a series with
  one long-lived writer, is never. The memo now records the time of the last
  SUCCESSFUL write and is redone every five minutes.

- **A job killed by its timeout is recorded.** Laravel raises `JobTimedOut` and
  then `posix_kill(SIGKILL)`s the worker — no shutdown function, no terminating
  callback. The listener only incremented a counter into the in-memory buffer
  and left the consumer span open, so nothing ever closed the attempt: the trace
  for a timed-out job, which is precisely the job you went looking for, was
  simply absent, and `queue.jobs.timed_out` read a flat zero no matter how many
  were timing out. It only bit when the attempt would be retried; with
  `tries=1` Laravel raises `JobFailed` first and that path flushed.

  The timeout now closes the attempt through the same `completeJob()` path as
  every other outcome — one source for the span, the duration, the
  memory/CPU attribution and the counter, so they cannot drift apart — and
  `WorkerStopping` flushes before the kill.

- **Redaction now reaches the span status description.** `recordException()`
  writes the exception message to two places: the `exception.message` event
  attribute, and the span's status description, which OTLP exports as
  `status.message`. The redaction engine scrubbed attributes and events but
  never the status, so an exception carrying a credential went out redacted in
  one field and **verbatim in the other** — the leak wearing the mask's own
  clothes. Reproduced with a bearer token: the event read
  `upstream rejected Bearer [REDACTED]` while the status carried the whole key.

  The existing test asserted only the event attribute, which is why this passed
  for so long; it now asserts both, so the pair cannot diverge again.

- **Broadcasting instrumentation no longer breaks a concrete
  `BroadcastManager` type hint.** The binding was replaced with a decorator that
  implemented `Contracts\Broadcasting\Factory` but did not extend Laravel's
  `BroadcastManager` — the class the container binds and the class app code
  hints. Any controller, service or resolving callback taking
  `BroadcastManager $broadcast` got a `TypeError` the moment this package was
  installed, which is an observability package breaking the app it observes.
  `__call` covered forwarded *calls* but can do nothing about a *type*.

  It now extends the concrete class, the same fix the filesystem got in 1.1.0.
  Behaviour is still delegated to the wrapped manager rather than inherited —
  the real manager owns the resolved drivers and anything registered through
  `extend()` — so every public method of the parent is overridden rather than
  left to run against this instance's empty state.

- **Filesystem instrumentation keeps drivers registered before it booted.** It
  replaced the `filesystem` binding by constructing a fresh manager and
  discarding the one it was extending, taking `$customCreators` and `$disks`
  with it. A provider that ran `Storage::extend('dropbox', …)` earlier in the
  boot order simply vanished, and the next resolution of that disk failed with
  *Driver [dropbox] is not supported*. A `Storage::fake()` set before the swap
  was dropped the same way. The replacement now adopts both.


## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **A console process now flushes what it measured before it exits.** Requests
  flush at terminate, jobs after each job, scheduled tasks after each task — a
  plain artisan command had no flush point at all unless `instrument.commands`
  was on, and it defaults to off. With `buffer_writes` on (also the default),
  every counter, gauge and histogram such a command wrote sat in the in-memory
  buffer and died with the process. A clean `exit(0)` is not the "hard crash"
  the performance docs warn about.

  This silently broke a documented metric. `queue.jobs.dispatched` is counted in
  the DISPATCHING process, so a command queueing 10 000 jobs reported none of
  them while the worker reported all 10 000 processed — the backlog panel read
  as permanently healthy. `queue.size`, pushed by `queue:monitor` (a command
  that exits immediately), could never appear at all.

  A terminating callback now drains the buffer. On the request path it is a
  no-op against an already-drained buffer, and it catches anything written by
  other terminating callbacks.

- **The inbound `server.address` metric label is no longer the caller's `Host`
  header.** `http.server.request.duration`, `http.server.memory.peak` and
  `http.server.cpu.time` took `$request->getHost()` whenever the matched route
  had no domain pattern — which is almost every route. Symfony validates that
  header only when the app configured trusted-host patterns, and Laravel ships
  with none, so on a default install an unauthenticated loop with an
  incrementing `Host:` minted a permanent series per value across three
  histograms. No route needs to match; an unrouted request is labelled too. No
  store in this package has a TTL or a cardinality cap, so nothing ages out.

  The route's domain pattern still wins and is unchanged. Without one the
  concrete host is used only when something the APP controls has vouched for
  it — trusted-host patterns exist (Symfony has already rejected anything else
  by then), or the host is the app's own, which is the single-domain case where
  the label is a constant and nothing is lost. Everything else reports `other`.

  **Upgrade note:** a multi-domain app with no `TrustHosts` and no domain routes
  now sees `other` where it saw its domains. Configure `TrustHosts`, or register
  the routes with a domain pattern; both are bounded by the app rather than by
  the caller.


## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **`Telemetry::classifyHttpHostsUsing()`** — bound the outgoing-host metric
  label. `server.address` goes onto `http.client.request.duration` and
  `http.client.connection_failures` as a label, which is safe only while every
  outbound host is one the app chose. An app that calls a host the USER supplied
  — an OAuth issuer pasted into a form, a customer webhook, a tenant's own API —
  grew a permanent series per hostname, and there was no way to bound it short
  of turning `instrument.http_client` off and losing the spans too. The
  connection-failure counter is the worse half: a hostname that never answered
  still creates a series, so it needs no cooperation from the host at all.

  The classifier mirrors `classifyCacheKeysUsing()`, which solves the identical
  problem one instrumentation over. The returned group replaces `server.address`
  on the metrics only — spans keep the real hostname — and returning `null`
  drops the metrics for that host while still recording the span. With no
  classifier registered, behaviour is unchanged.
### Fixed

- **`telemetry:monitor` scopes its gauges to the host that measured them.** Every
  gauge the command writes describes ONE machine, but they were written with only
  `state`/`period`/`direction` labels into a store shared by the whole fleet —
  which is the package's reason to exist. `system.memory.usage{state="used"}` was
  therefore a single series that every host overwrote in turn, and the elected
  `telemetry:flush` exported the survivor stamped with its OWN `host.name`
  resource. One host's memory silently read as another's and the rest of the
  fleet was simply absent, which is the opposite of what a node_exporter analog
  is for. `process.count` and `process.memory.rss` had it too, so a per-host
  queue-worker count was really "whichever host wrote last".

  All of them now carry a `host` label. Cardinality is the size of the fleet.
  This is the one place host identity belongs on the metric rather than the
  resource: the resource is attached by whoever *exports*, which under
  `onOneServer` is not whoever measured.

  **Upgrade note:** existing `system.*` and `process.*` series gain a label.
  Dashboards that sum or select them without a `host` matcher keep working;
  panels pinned to the exact old labelset need the new dimension.


## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **`telemetry:monitor --once` reports CPU utilization.** It never had. The
  command deltas CPU between its own ticks, holding the previous snapshot in an
  instance property — but a single run is always a *first* sample: the process
  exits and the property dies with it, so the delta branch was unreachable and
  `system.cpu.utilization` was silently absent from every cron-mode sample.
  `--once` is the mode the docs recommend for hosts without a supervisor, and
  the failure looked like nothing at all: memory, load, disk and network all
  landed, so the metric appeared to be missing from the dashboard rather than
  from the host.

  Cron mode now pays for one short blocking sample instead — the same
  `SystemMetrics::cpuUsage()` the scrape-time provider takes, sized by the same
  `providers.system.cpu_interval` key. Daemon mode is unchanged and still
  deltas between ticks with no sleep.


## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **A `null` in `Telemetry::context()` now means "not set" — it removes the
  dimension instead of recording an empty one.** Spans take context through
  `mergeMissingAttributes()`, whose `??=` creates the key even for a null, and
  the OTLP serializer has no null — it ships an empty string. So an app
  mirroring an optional dimension (`['tenant.id' => $tenant?->id]`, the shape
  every multi-tenant integration reaches for) stamped an empty attribute on
  every span raised outside a tenant: every console command, every
  unauthenticated request. The only way to avoid it was to filter nulls at each
  call site, which is a workaround the package was silently requiring.

  Null also gives callers a way to clear one dimension mid-unit-of-work.
  Previously the only lever was `resetContext()`, which drops the trace
  continuation along with it — so code that wanted to stop attributing spans to
  a tenant had to choose between a stale value and a broken trace.

  Passing null was previously the only way to get an empty-string attribute
  from context, which nothing would do deliberately, so this is a fix in
  practice. It is filed as Changed because `contextAttributes()` now returns
  `array<string, scalar>` rather than `array<string, scalar|null>`.


## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **`Telemetry::fake()` now measures span resources, like the real tracer.**
  `TelemetryFake` built its tracer as `new Tracer(sampleRate: 1.0)` and never
  called `measureSpanResources()`, which the service provider does apply to
  the real tracer whenever `instrument.resources` is on — the default. So
  every span recorded through the fake was missing `php.cpu.time_ms` and
  `php.memory.delta_bytes`, and a test asserting on either failed against a
  double that was quietly less capable than production. The divergence was
  invisible from the other direction too: root spans still carried the
  request middleware's own `php.memory.peak_bytes` and
  `process.memory.rss_peak_bytes`, because those are set explicitly rather
  than by the tracer, so only child spans came back bare.

  To model an app with `instrument.resources => false`, turn it off on the
  fake's tracer: `$fake->tracer()->measureSpanResources(false)`.


## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-09

Entry written retroactively — the release was tagged without one.

### Fixed

- **`telemetry:monitor --once` reports a sample it could not ship.** The
  command discarded `flush()`'s report and returned `SUCCESS` regardless, so
  read from cron — where the exit code is the whole report — a host that
  sampled fine and then failed to ship looked identical to a healthy one.
  The same blind spot `telemetry:flush` had in 1.2.0, one command over.
  `--once` now names the exporter and each problem, logs at `error`, and
  exits non-zero. The daemon reports to the log instead, and only when the
  failure changes, so a collector down for an hour writes one line rather
  than 3,600 — and one more when batches start landing again. `flush()` is
  wrapped in `FailSafe` like the samplers around it, so a throwing exporter
  reports as a failure instead of taking the loop down. (#12)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-08

Two things. Telemetry now runs on a device — NativePHP for Mobile v4
(SuperNative) and Desktop v2, which break the two assumptions this package
was built on: there is no Redis or APCu, and nothing can scrape a Prometheus
endpoint on someone's phone. And `telemetry:flush` stopped lying about
batches the backend rejected.

**Upgrade note.** Four `TelemetryManager` methods now return
`Support\ExportReport` where they returned `void`, and `flushMetrics()`
returned an undocumented `int`. The facade advertised all four as `void`, so
the documented surface is unchanged and callers are unaffected — but code
that used `flushMetrics()`'s int, code that consumed `SpoolShipper::ship()`'s
array shape, or a subclass of `TelemetryManager` overriding any of the four
will need the new signatures. None of those are in the surface the 1.0.0
release put under SemVer, which is why this is a minor.

### Fixed

- **`telemetry:flush` no longer reports success for a batch the backend
  rejected.** Against an endpoint answering `HTTP 400` to every request the
  command printed *"Flushed 57 metric families to 1 exporter(s)"* and exited
  `0`. Nothing was stored, `telemetry:doctor` was green, and the only way to
  find out was a packet capture.

  The transport classified the failure correctly all along —
  `OtlpTransport::post()` returned `ExportResult::failed("HTTP 400: …")` — and
  `OtlpExporter` passed it up faithfully. It was dropped one level higher:
  `TelemetryManager::export()` fed the result to the self-metrics counter and
  then discarded it, returning `void`, and `flushMetrics()` returned the number
  of families *collected* — a count of what was offered, reported as a count of
  what landed.

  Flushes now return an `ExportReport` (`Support\ExportReport`,
  `ExportOutcome`, `ExportStatus`) naming what each exporter did with the
  batch, and the command turns it into output, a log line and an exit code:

  - A rejected batch prints the exporter, the HTTP status and the backend's
    response body (collapsed to one line, truncated at 500 characters), and
    **exits non-zero** — cron is the only thing watching, and a silent success
    there is the original bug one level down.
  - Failures are logged at `error` as well as printed, since nobody reads
    cron's stdout.
  - Partial delivery is reported as partial: *"2 of 3 exporters accepted the
    batch"*, rather than a flat "flushed" or a flat failure. OTLP partial
    success (the backend took the batch but refused some data points) counts
    as a problem too.
  - A failing exporter still does not throw, and never stops the remaining
    exporters from being tried.
  - In `--daemon` mode a persistent failure is reported once, not once per
    tick, and recovery is reported when exports start landing again.

  The same silence was in the other two paths and is fixed with it:
  `SpoolShipper::ship()` counted permanently-rejected entries as `dropped`
  without recording *why* (that data is discarded, so the reason was the only
  evidence it ever existed), and `telemetry:deploy` reported a deployment
  marker as emitted whether or not the backend took it. A spool drain that
  requeues or drops now fails the flush command's exit code as well.

- **`telemetry:doctor` probes OTLP with a payload the exporter would really
  send.** It posted an empty batch — 24 bytes, under the transport's 1 KB gzip
  threshold — so it tested a path the exporter never takes and passed against a
  backend (or proxy) that rejects every compressed request. It now posts one
  real, gzipped span named `telemetry.doctor`, serialized by the real
  serializer, and says so in its output.

### Added

- **`Testing\RejectingExporter`** — a fake exporter that refuses batches, so an
  application can test the unhappy path. `CollectingExporter` (behind
  `Telemetry::fake()`) always answers `ok()`, which is exactly why a suite
  could be green while the flush command lied. Takes any `ExportResult`, so a
  503 or an OTLP partial success can be modelled too. See
  `docs/getting-started/testing.md`.

### Changed

- **`TelemetryManager::flush()`, `flushMetrics()`, `ingestSpans()` and
  `ingestEvents()` return `Support\ExportReport`** instead of `void`/`int`.
  `flushMetrics()` previously returned the number of metric families
  collected; that count is now `$report->items`, with delivery reported
  separately — conflating the two is what made the failure invisible. The
  facade advertised all four as `void`, so the returned int was never part of
  the documented surface.
- **`SpoolShipper::ship()` returns `Exporters\Spool\ShipResult`** instead of an
  `array{shipped, requeued, dropped}` shape, carrying the failures with the
  counts.

### Added

- **NativePHP support — mobile v4 (SuperNative) and desktop v2.** See
  `docs/cookbook/nativephp.md`.
  - `sqlite` metric store driver (`TELEMETRY_STORE=sqlite`) for runtimes with
    neither Redis nor APCu. Durable across app restarts, and safe for the
    several PHP processes a desktop app runs. Sits behind `BufferedMetricStore`
    like the other shared stores.
  - `sqlite` spool driver (`TELEMETRY_OTLP_SPOOL_DRIVER=sqlite`) so a device
    that spent the afternoon offline still has its telemetry when it
    reconnects — the Redis spool dies with the process.
  - `Instrumentation\NativeScreenInstrumentation` — screen and interaction
    telemetry for mobile v4, in two halves. Screen views (`screen.views`,
    `screen.view.duration`, `screen.view` events) come free from the upstream
    `Native\Mobile\Events\Screen\*` lifecycle events on `nativephp/mobile`
    ^4.1, behind a `class_exists` guard so 4.0.x never arms them. Interaction spans stay opt-in:
    a native screen holds one request open for its whole lifetime, so
    `Kernel::terminate()` never fires and the per-request flush never happens —
    and upstream announces no interaction, so the app forwards
    `dispatch()`/`dispatchNativeEvent()` from one shared base class.
  - Automatic state reset on `Native\Mobile\Runtime::onReset()`, the persistent
    runtime's equivalent of the existing Octane reset.
- Architecture decision records under `docs/decisions/`. The first restates
  invariant #3 in terms of shared *writers*, which is what makes a
  process-local store correct on a single-writer runtime.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-05

Fixes a `TypeError` that made `instrument.filesystem` unusable alongside any
package that type-hints Laravel's concrete `FilesystemAdapter` — Statamic's
imaging being the reported case. Minor rather than patch only because it ships
a new config key alongside the fix.

### Fixed

- **An instrumented disk is now a real `Illuminate\Filesystem\FilesystemAdapter`.**
  `InstrumentedFilesystem` implemented only the `Filesystem` contract, so any
  consumer that type-hints Laravel's concrete adapter got a `TypeError` the
  moment it touched an instrumented disk. Statamic hits this saving an asset —
  `Imaging\Attributes::from()` takes a `FilesystemAdapter` — so
  `AssetContainer::find(…)->makeAsset(…)->save()` died with *"Argument #1
  ($source) must be of type FilesystemAdapter,
  Cbox\Telemetry\Instrumentation\InstrumentedFilesystem given"*. Because
  `instrument.filesystem` is all-or-nothing, the only workaround was disabling
  disk instrumentation entirely.

  Disks that resolve to a concrete adapter — every driver Laravel ships — are
  now wrapped in `InstrumentedFilesystemAdapter`, a genuine subclass. Same fix
  the manager got in 0.3.1, one level further down. Custom `Storage::extend()`
  drivers returning their own `Filesystem` keep the original decorator; there
  is no concrete type to preserve there. `instanceof Filesystem` holds either
  way, adapter extras (`url()`, `temporaryUrl()`) and macros keep working, and
  nothing instrumented before stopped being.

  Behaviour is delegated to the wrapped disk rather than inherited, because
  `AwsS3V3Adapter` and `LocalFilesystemAdapter` override `url()` and
  `temporaryUrl()` — running the parent's generic versions would have silently
  handed back wrong URLs, a worse failure than the TypeError being fixed.

### Added

- **`instrument.filesystem_ignore_disks`** — disks left entirely
  uninstrumented, by name. PHP cannot choose a parent class at runtime, so an
  instrumented disk satisfies `instanceof FilesystemAdapter` but can never
  satisfy `instanceof AwsS3V3Adapter`. This is the escape hatch for a disk
  whose consumers need the exact subclass. It is also why this release is a
  **minor** rather than a patch — the fix on its own would have been `1.0.1`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-15

First stable release. The public surface — the span & metric emitters, the
`Contracts\*` interfaces, config keys, and the FailSafe guarantees — is now
covered by Semantic Versioning, and the 1.x line commits to backward
compatibility. Functionally this promotes the 0.4.x line to stable; there are no
behavioural changes beyond the fix below, which was staged as 0.4.1 but never
tagged and is rolled up here.

### Fixed

- **Redis instrumentation no longer tries to open the `client`/`options`/`cluster`
  config keys as connections.** When `instrument.redis` is on, retro-fitting
  already-resolved connections enumerated every key under `database.redis` and
  skipped only `options`, so a `client` key (the phpredis/predis selector, present
  in every default Laravel config) threw "Redis connection [client] not configured"
  on every request. It was FailSafe-guarded, so no request broke, but it flooded
  the log. All reserved keys (`client`, `options`, `cluster`) are now skipped. (#4)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Disabling telemetry no longer breaks app code.** `Http::withTraceparent()`
  and the `@telemetryTraceparent` Blade directive were only registered when
  `telemetry.enabled` was true, so flipping `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` made
  every call site throw a `BadMethodCallException` (and directives render as
  literal text). Both are now always registered and behave as no-ops when
  disabled.
- **`@telemetryBrowser` was documented but never registered as a Blade
  directive** — it rendered as literal text in any layout that used it. The
  directive now exists and emits `BrowserSnippet::render()` (empty when the
  span ingest or telemetry itself is disabled).
- **`telemetry:flush --wipe` no longer makes warm workers' metrics invisible.**
  Wipe used to delete metric meta and index entries while other FPM/Octane/queue
  processes kept their per-process "already initialized" memo — everything they
  wrote after the wipe was silently dropped until every process recycled. Wipe
  now resets values but preserves meta and indexes (and resets the cumulative
  start timestamp). APCu wipe also clears histogram exemplars, which previously
  survived.
- **A metric type conflict can no longer throw on every query.** The
  `db.queries` counter registration inside the `QueryExecuted` listener ran
  outside `FailSafe::guard`; an app registering the same name as another
  instrument type would have turned every subsequent query into an exception.
- **Custom exporters can no longer take down kernel terminate.** A throwing
  `supports()`/`name()` on a custom exporter escaped `FailSafe::guard` during
  `flush()`; the whole per-exporter interaction is now guarded, and one bad
  exporter never blocks the others.
- **Half-open instrumentation state is dropped between queue jobs.** In-flight
  outgoing-HTTP spans (and mail/notification/transaction state) left behind by
  a job that died mid-call leaked in long-running workers and could mis-attach
  to a later job. Workers now flush that state before each job, mirroring the
  Octane fresh-request reset.

### Changed

- **`worker.memory.php` / `worker.memory.rss` gauges no longer accumulate dead
  pid series.** Workers retire their own pid-labeled series on
  `WorkerStopping`, so restarts don't grow the store and dashboards don't show
  stale memory lines for dead processes.
- **BREAKING for custom `MetricStore` implementations:** the contract gained
  `forgetSeries(MetricDefinition $definition, array $labels): void` (remove a
  single labelset from a family). All bundled stores implement it.
- Stores skip metric families with no samples at collect time (possible after
  a wipe or `forgetSeries`) instead of emitting empty families.
- Livewire instrumentation now allows Livewire 4 (`livewire/livewire`
  `^3.0|^4.0`); the suite passes against v4.
- CI: the PHP 8.3 × Laravel 13 matrix cell is no longer excluded, benchmarks
  are excluded from the test matrix, `composer audit` runs in CI (plus weekly),
  and the Pint workflow only checks style instead of auto-committing to main.
- Supply chain: added `bin/check-licenses.php` (permissive-license gate),
  `bin/generate-sbom.php` (deterministic CycloneDX 1.5 `sbom.json`, committed),
  composer scripts `license-check`/`sbom`/`qa`, and a CI drift gate;
  `composer.lock` is now committed.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Docs only: added `_index.md` section landings and the root
  quickstart/requirements pages so the docs site grades the package
  `complete`. No code changes.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **`Storage::shouldReceive(...)` / `Storage::partialMock()` broke in app
  test suites (regression from 0.3.1).** Because `InstrumentedFilesystemManager`
  replaces the `'filesystem'` binding, marking it `final` meant Mockery could
  no longer build a partial mock of the resolved instance — the standard
  Laravel facade-mocking pattern failed with *"is marked final and its methods
  cannot be replaced"*. The class is now non-final (Laravel's own
  `FilesystemManager` is non-final for exactly this reason); it is marked
  `@internal` instead to signal "don't extend this yourself".

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Boot crash for apps that also use `sentry/sentry-laravel` (or anything
  that type-hints `Illuminate\Filesystem\FilesystemManager`).** Filesystem
  instrumentation replaced the `'filesystem'` binding with a standalone
  decorator that was not a `FilesystemManager` subclass. Because Laravel
  aliases `FilesystemManager::class` to `'filesystem'`, any typed
  `afterResolving(FilesystemManager::class, …)` callback, constructor
  injection, or `app(FilesystemManager::class)` received the wrapper and
  threw a `TypeError` the moment the binding resolved — Sentry's storage
  integration was simply the first to hit it. `InstrumentedFilesystemManager`
  now `extends FilesystemManager`, so `instanceof FilesystemManager` holds
  while `storage.operations{disk,operation}` counters and per-operation
  detail spans continue to fire unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Campaign attribution on analytics page views (`TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_UTM`,
  default off).** With `telemetry.analytics.utm` enabled, the
  `analytics.page_view` event now carries the landing URL's UTM parameters as
  `analytics.utm.source` / `medium` / `campaign` / `content` / `term` (values
  lowercased, trimmed and length-capped; a key appears only when its param is
  present and non-empty), plus a low-cardinality `analytics.click_id` — the
  NAME of the paid ad-network click-id parameter present (`gclid`, `gbraid`,
  `wbraid`, `msclkid`, `dclid`, `ttclid`, `twclid`, `yclid`, first match
  wins), never its unbounded value. `fbclid` is deliberately excluded — Meta
  appends it to organic clicks too, so it is not a reliable paid signal. This
  applies to both the server page view and the browser analytics ingest: the
  browser SDK now sends the landing `url.full` on page-view events, and the
  ingest endpoint derives the same keys from it (never from the ingest
  request's own URL). Strictly additive — nothing is stamped when the flag is
  off. See `Support\CampaignAttribution`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Built-in Cloudflare geo, and server-side geo/UA enrichment at browser
  ingest.** With `TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_GEO=true`, `client.geo.country` now
  resolves from Cloudflare's `CF-IPCountry` edge header with no MaxMind
  database and no per-request lookup — free on every plan. Precedence is
  `resolveClientGeoUsing()` hook → `CF-IPCountry` → MaxMind. The header is
  only trusted when the request arrives through a trusted proxy — set Laravel
  `TrustProxies` to the immediate hop (your Cloudflare ranges, or your load
  balancer in a `CF → LB → app` chain); it is spoofable and ignored
  otherwise, and the `XX`/`T1` sentinels are dropped. Toggle with
  `TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_GEO_CF` (default on). The browser ingest endpoint now
  enriches browser spans and events with geo and parsed `user_agent.*` from
  the server-side ingest request — the browser can't know its own country,
  but the ingest request carries it — so nearly all enrichment happens in
  one server-side place.

- **Livewire update requests are named after their component.** Livewire's
  update endpoint is a catch-all — every component update POSTs to the same
  URL, so `http.route` identified nothing. The Livewire instrumentation now
  collects the component names as they mount/hydrate, and the request
  middleware names the logical route `livewire:{component}` (batched
  updates: `livewire:batch`) — on the span, the span name and the request
  metric label — the same way a CMS resolver replaces its `/{segments?}`
  catch-all. The root span carries the full list in `livewire.components`.
  An app's own `resolveRouteUsing()` still wins.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-06

First tagged release without a pre-release suffix: the public API
surface described in `docs/getting-started/api-reference.md` is now
considered stable enough for production pilots, and breaking changes
from here on bump the minor version per SemVer 0.x rules.

### Added

- **`enduser.id` on exception records**: the structured exception record
  now carries the authenticated user's id (guests omit it), so issue
  tooling can count affected users per error group, Sentry-style.

### Fixed

- **Unbounded recursion in `FailSafe` during `report()`**: the default
  failure handler is `report()`, and the exception subscriber runs *inside*
  `report()` — so a guarded path that kept failing while an exception was
  being reported (e.g. the `enduser.id` auth lookup with the database down)
  re-entered the subscriber on every cycle and recursed until memory
  exhaustion. `FailSafe::handle()` now carries a re-entrancy latch: a
  telemetry failure that occurs while another telemetry failure is already
  being reported is swallowed instead of re-reported.

## [0.1.0-alpha.17] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`db.queries` counter** (`db_queries_total{connection,driver}`): every
  executed query, labeled by the configured connection and its driver —
  the database twin of `redis.commands`, so dashboards can show per-host
  database activity without depending on tail-sampled traces. Bounded
  labels; query text never becomes a label.

- **Cookbook: Deploy annotations** — copy-paste Forge/Envoyer/GitHub
  Actions deploy-script snippets for `telemetry:deploy`, filling
  `--id`/`--notes` from the actual commit being deployed. `--id` already
  auto-detects the git sha without shelling out (`Support\GitVersion`);
  `--notes` has no equivalent, since the commit message can be
  delta-packed and isn't worth parsing git's pack format for. Rather
  than shelling out to `git log` in the deploy script, the recipe uses
  each platform's own deployment variables (Forge's
  `$FORGE_DEPLOY_COMMIT`/`$FORGE_DEPLOY_MESSAGE` env vars, Envoyer's
  `{{ sha }}`/`{{ message }}` template syntax, GitHub Actions'
  `github.sha`/`github.event.head_commit.message`) — no git CLI or
  `.git` presence assumption needed in any of them.

## [0.1.0-alpha.16] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **A real overhead benchmark** (`tests/Feature/Benchmark/OverheadBenchmarkTest.php`,
  `vendor/bin/pest --group=benchmark`, excluded from `composer test`):
  replaces this project's previously unverified "zero-cost"/"in-memory
  only" claims with actual measured numbers — full default
  instrumentation adds under 1ms median per request on the test harness
  (see docs/production/performance.md for methodology, caveats, and how
  this compares to Nightwatch's published "<3ms" and Sentry-PHP's
  documented lack-of-background-threads constraint, which this package
  shares).
- **`telemetry:doctor` spool-depth check**: the spool is drained
  exclusively by `telemetry:flush` — if the daemon dies or was never
  scheduled, the list just grows until it hits `max_items` and starts
  silently dropping its oldest entries, with no other warning. Doctor
  now reports current depth as a fraction of `max_items`, warns above
  50% full and fails the check above 90%.
- **Filesystem/Storage instrumentation** (`instrument.filesystem`,
  default on): `storage.operations{disk,operation}` counter + a
  `storage {operation}` detail span per disk operation (put, get,
  delete, copy, move, …) — driver-agnostic (local, S3, whatever
  Flysystem supports) via a `Factory`/`Filesystem` decorator.
  Instruments both `Storage::disk('x')->put(...)` and the
  `Storage::put(...)` default-disk shorthand. Paths are safe on spans
  (per-occurrence) but never metric labels, same rule as query text.
  Built carefully after two near-misses in review: routing every
  unknown manager method through the wrapped disk broke
  `Storage::fake()` (which calls `set()`/`createLocalDriver()` — real
  manager methods, not disk operations) — fixed by implementing the
  `Filesystem` interface's operations explicitly on the manager
  decorator too, rather than guessing via `__call()`.
- **OTel span links for queue retries** (`instrument.queue_retry_links`,
  default on): a retried job's attempt N+1 span now links (not parents)
  back to attempt N's span — they're siblings, both children of the
  original dispatch, not a continuation chain. Bridged via the app's
  own cache (`queue.retry_link_store`/`_ttl`, keyed by the job's stable
  UUID) since a retry can land on a different worker process; a
  null/array cache driver just means retries go unlinked, no error.
  New `Tracing\SpanLink` value object and `Span::links()`/OTLP
  `links` array serialization — general-purpose infrastructure, not
  specific to queues, for any future causal-but-non-hierarchical
  relationship between spans.
- **W3C Baggage propagation** (`instrument.baggage`, default on):
  `Telemetry::context()` dimensions (team, tenant, plan, …) now cross a
  real HTTP service boundary, not just process/job boundaries.
  `Http::withTraceparent()` attaches a `baggage` header alongside
  `traceparent`; the receiving app merges an incoming `baggage` header
  back into its own context, gated on `traces.continue_incoming` too
  since baggage is caller-supplied, unvalidated data. New
  `Support\Baggage` class handles the percent-encoded, comma-separated
  wire format (spec's own 8192-byte/180-member budget enforced on encode).
- **Vapor/Lambda FaaS resource attributes** (part of `resource_detection`,
  no separate toggle): `cloud.provider=aws`, `cloud.platform=aws_lambda`,
  `faas.name`/`.version`/`.instance`/`.max_memory` from AWS Lambda's own
  runtime env vars — Vapor included, since it runs on Bref's PHP-FPM
  Lambda layer. `faas.coldstart` is re-evaluated per invocation (true
  only for the first request served by a given execution environment)
  even though the rest of the detected resource is memoized for the
  process. `vapor.detected` flags Vapor specifically.
- **Rate limiter instrumentation** (`instrument.rate_limiting`, default
  on): `rate_limit.exceeded{limiter}` counter from a 429 response — the
  driver-agnostic signal, since Laravel's `RateLimiter` fires no event.
  Labeled by the `throttle:<name>` route middleware's limiter name when
  present, `default` for an inline `throttle:60,1` spec, `unknown` with
  no throttle middleware at all (still counted — any 429 is a rate
  limit signal, from a custom limiter or not).
- **Generic broadcasting instrumentation** (`instrument.broadcasting`,
  default on): `broadcast.count` root-span tally + a `broadcast {event}`
  detail span per `Broadcaster::broadcast()` call — driver-agnostic
  (Pusher, Ably, Reverb, Redis, Log, …), via a `Factory`/`Broadcaster`
  decorator rather than an event listener (Laravel fires no
  "broadcasting" event). Carries `broadcasting.driver`,
  `broadcasting.event`, `broadcasting.channel.count` and a bounded
  `broadcasting.channels` shape (`public`/`private`/`presence`) — never
  raw channel names. Complements, and is unaffected by, Reverb's own
  richer connection/channel-occupancy instrumentation.
- **Livewire component lifecycle** (`instrument.livewire`, default on,
  auto-activates when `livewire/livewire` is installed): registered via
  Livewire's own `ComponentHook` API. `mount`/`hydrate` have no "after"
  phase in that API — the hook is one peer listener among Livewire's own
  internal ones, not a wrapper around them — so those are counters
  (`livewire.components.mounted`/`.hydrated`). `render`/`update`/`call`
  DO wrap the real work (Livewire invokes a returned closure once the
  phase finishes), so those get real detail spans
  (`livewire.render`/`.update`/`.call`), same tail-sampled,
  root-span-tallied shape as view rendering — nested naturally under
  whatever page or request is currently tracing.
- **Inertia.js awareness** (`instrument.inertia`, default on): `inertia.request`
  span attribute from the `X-Inertia` header, plus an `inertia.version_mismatches`
  counter and `inertia.version_mismatch` span attribute when the response
  carries `X-Inertia-Location` — Inertia's own signal that it's forcing a
  full page reload after an asset-version bump. Pure response inspection;
  no dependency on `inertiajs/inertia-laravel` being installed.
- **Histogram exemplars** (no config toggle — follows `traces.sample_rate`):
  every observation made inside a sampled trace carries that trace's id,
  bridging a slow Prometheus bucket to the actual trace that landed in
  it. One exemplar per histogram series (the most recent sampled
  observation), not one per bucket — a deliberate simplification of the
  full spec that needed no store schema rewrite. Only renders when the
  scraper negotiates OpenMetrics via `Accept: application/openmetrics-text`
  (the classic text format has no grammar for it); the default scrape
  response is unchanged.
- **CPU profiling via ext-excimer** (`instrument.profiling`, default on,
  a silent no-op without the PECL `excimer` extension): tail-based, like
  `traces.details.mode`. Excimer's own sampling keeps overhead low, so
  profiling always runs on a sampled trace, but the result — a bounded
  "top functions by sample count" `profile.captured` event — is only kept
  for requests/jobs slower than `profiling.min_duration_ms` (default
  500ms). Not a full pprof export; the package has no opinion on a
  profiling backend, this is enough to see where a slow unit of work
  spent its CPU without one. `telemetry:doctor` reports whether the
  extension is active.
- **Core Web Vitals in the browser RUM script** (`ingest.spans.browser.vitals`,
  default on): `web_vitals.lcp_ms`, `web_vitals.cls` and a simplified
  `web_vitals.inp_ms` (worst single interaction observed, not the full
  spec's high-percentile calculation) via `PerformanceObserver`, shipped
  as one `web-vitals` span at page hide/unload — LCP/CLS are not final
  until then, so reporting on `load` would be wrong. No dependency added;
  still the zero-build script.
- **N+1 / duplicate query detection** (`instrument.query_duplicates`,
  default on): flags a query that runs identically more than once in the
  same trace — `model.hydrations` was already an N+1 *proxy* (a raw
  hydration count); this names the actual repeated query. Laravel's
  `QueryExecuted::$sql` is already parameterized (bindings are separate),
  so the raw SQL text is a solid fingerprint without normalization.
  `db.query.duplicate.count` root-span tally, `db.queries.duplicated{connection}`
  counter, and a `db.query.duplicate_detected` OTLP log event carrying
  the query text — fires once per distinct query, at the configurable
  threshold crossing (`instrument.query_duplicates_threshold`, default
  3), not once per repeat.
- **Horizon, Reverb and Pennant instrumentation** — auto-activates when
  the package is installed (`class_exists`-guarded, never a hard
  dependency):
  - `laravel/horizon`: `horizon.supervisor.processes`/`.paused` and
    `horizon.master.paused`/`.supervisors` gauges pushed from the
    supervisor/master heartbeat; `horizon.long_wait.detected` (counter +
    OTLP log event), `horizon.process.restarts{type}`,
    `horizon.process.out_of_memory{type}` (counter + event), and
    `horizon.jobs.migrated`. Job-level tracing already worked without
    this — Horizon workers fire the standard queue events
    `QueueInstrumentation` listens to; this class deliberately does not
    duplicate that with Horizon's own per-operation Redis events.
  - `laravel/reverb`: `reverb.messages{direction,app}`,
    `reverb.channels{event,type}` and `reverb.connections.pruned{app}`,
    plus live occupancy — `reverb.connections.active{app}` and
    `reverb.channels.subscribers{app,type}` — read directly from Reverb's
    own `MetricsHandler` (no HTTP round trip, since this runs inside the
    `reverb:start` process already) and sampled off existing message/
    connection traffic, throttled to once per 15s per app. Channel names
    and connection ids are never used as labels — only the bounded
    channel type (public/private/presence) and the operator-configured
    app id.
  - `laravel/pennant`: `feature.checks{feature,result}` (every
    `Feature::active()`/`value()` check, cache hit or fresh) and
    `feature.unknown{feature}`. The scope (usually a user/tenant model)
    is never used as a label.
  - New config: `instrument.horizon`, `instrument.reverb`,
    `instrument.pennant` (all default `true`).
- **`telemetry:doctor` now flags a cache/metric-store collision**:
  `php artisan cache:clear` is not prefix-aware — Laravel's Redis cache
  store runs a raw `FLUSHDB`, and the apcu driver calls
  `apcu_clear_cache()` (wipes the whole shared segment machine-wide). If
  telemetry's store shares the same Redis database or apcu segment as
  your cache, a routine cache clear silently empties every metric.
  `telemetry:doctor` now detects and warns about this.

### Fixed

- **`telemetry:flush`'s cron/one-shot path was unguarded**, unlike the
  daemon loop which wraps every equivalent call in `FailSafe::guard`.
  A Redis outage during a scheduled `telemetry:flush` run could dump a
  raw stack trace to the console instead of a clean error. Now guarded
  consistently with the daemon path, failing with a clear message and
  a non-zero exit code (so cron/monitoring still catches it) rather
  than an uncaught exception.

### Changed (breaking security hardening)

- The Prometheus scrape endpoint is now **closed by default outside
  `local`/`testing`** — the same convention as Horizon/Telescope/Pulse.
  Previously an empty `allowed_ips` meant "allow everyone"; now it means
  "closed" unless the app is running in `local`/`testing`. Open it with
  `TELEMETRY_ALLOWED_IPS` (unchanged), the new `TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_TOKEN`
  bearer token (checked with `hash_equals()`, matches Prometheus's own
  `authorization.credentials` scrape config), or your own middleware.
  **If you rely on the endpoint being open in production without an IP
  allowlist, set `TELEMETRY_PROMETHEUS_TOKEN` before upgrading** —
  `telemetry:doctor` reports `CLOSED` when a scrape would now 403.

## [0.1.0-alpha.15] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- Browser span/event ingest (`SpanIngestController`) no longer exports to
  OTLP inline in the request cycle — the built spans/events are stashed on
  the request and exported by a new terminable `Http\Middleware\FlushBrowserIngest`
  (auto-attached to the ingest route), so a slow/down collector can no
  longer add curl latency to this world-reachable endpoint's response.
- Static analysis raised from PHPStan/Larastan level 8 to level 9. A new
  `Support\Cast` helper type-narrows `mixed` values (config reads, framework
  interfaces typed `mixed`) into their expected shape, degrading to a sane
  default instead of PHP's silent, often-wrong scalar coercions.
- `tests/Unit` and `tests/Feature` now mirror `src/`'s subdirectory
  structure, matching `cboxdk/system-metrics` and `cboxdk/laravel-queue-metrics`.

### Fixed

- `TelemetryManager::labelRequestsUsing()` had lost its docblock to a
  copy-paste artifact (an orphaned block sat above `nameRequestsUsing()`
  instead); both are documented correctly now.
- `Span::cpuNowMs()` no longer assumes every `getrusage()` key is present.
- `QueueInstrumentation::completeJob()`'s trailing `flush()`/`resetContext()`
  now run inside `FailSafe::guard`, consistent with the rest of the file.
- Removed a duplicated docblock on `PrometheusRenderer::render()`.
- `Facades\Telemetry`'s `@method` docblock was missing `resolveSessionUsing()`,
  `resolveClientGeoUsing()`, `ingestSpans()` and `ingestEvents()`.
- `ScheduleInstrumentation` cast `$event->task->timezone` straight to
  `string`, which fatal-errors when a schedule uses `->timezone(new
  DateTimeZone(...))` instead of a timezone name string; now handles
  `DateTimeZone`, `string` and the `config('app.timezone')` fallback
  explicitly.
- Added test coverage for `Providers\SystemMetricsProvider` (previously none).

## [0.1.0-alpha.14] - 2026-07-05

Analytics — built-in geo + User-Agent parsing (opt-in, optional deps).

### Added

- **User-Agent parsing** (`TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_UA`, off). Dependency-free
  `Support\UserAgentParser` turns `user_agent.original` into low-cardinality
  `user_agent.name` / `os.name` / `device.type` (mobile/tablet/desktop/bot) —
  families only, never versions, so they stay safe group-by dimensions.
- **Geo from the IP** (`TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_GEO` + `..._GEO_DB`, off).
  `Support\GeoResolver` resolves `client.geo.country` (+ continent) via an
  **optional** MaxMind database (`geoip2/geoip2` is a composer *suggest*, not
  a requirement) at collection time, so the raw IP can be dropped. The reader
  is built lazily and cached — no boot-time I/O — and it is a silent no-op
  without the package/database. A `resolveClientGeoUsing()` hook (e.g.
  Cloudflare) always wins over it.

## [0.1.0-alpha.13] - 2026-07-04

Analytics — browser event channel (SPA views, engagement, custom events).

### Added

- **The span ingest also accepts analytics `events`.** The browser posts
  page views / engagement / custom `track()` calls under an `events` key; the
  endpoint re-emits them as **unsampled OTLP log records** (bounded and
  validated like spans) with `analytics.source="browser"` +
  `telemetry.stream="analytics"` markers — the same stream as the server's
  `analytics.page_view`. New `TelemetryManager::ingestEvents()`.
- **`@telemetryBrowser` emits `data-analytics`** when `telemetry.analytics`
  is on, so the SDK turns on its analytics channel: SPA page-view events
  (with `document.referrer`), engagement (visible time + scroll depth), a
  `track(name, props)` conversion API, and screen/DPR device dimensions.
- The [Analytics guide](docs/production/analytics.md) now covers the browser
  channel and a **LogQL cookbook** so a low-traffic LGTM stack answers
  top-pages / views-over-time / referrers / approximate uniques without
  ClickHouse.

## [0.1.0-alpha.12] - 2026-07-04

Analytics — unsampled page-view events.

### Added

- **`analytics.page_view` events (opt-in).** Each top-level document load (a
  GET returning HTML, non-AJAX) emits an `analytics.page_view` **event** — an
  OTLP log record, not a span — so it bypasses trace sampling and a page view
  is never undercounted, even when the full trace is tail-sampled away. It
  carries `trace_id` + `session.id` as the bridge to the waterfall, plus a
  flat one-row-per-view shape (`url.path`, `http.route`, status, referrer,
  `user_agent.original`, `enduser.id`, `client.geo.*`) and a
  `telemetry.stream="analytics"` marker so an OTel Collector can route the
  stream to ClickHouse with no app change. Toggle with
  `TELEMETRY_ANALYTICS_PAGE_VIEWS` (default on when analytics is enabled).
- New [Analytics guide](docs/production/analytics.md).

## [0.1.0-alpha.11] - 2026-07-04

Analytics foundation — the shared `session.id` keystone (opt-in, default off).

### Added

- **`telemetry.analytics` config (default off).** The first, additive step
  toward observability-grade analytics on top of the telemetry we already
  collect. Nothing changes when the flag is off.
- **Shared `session.id` across browser + server.** With analytics on, the
  request middleware stamps a `session.id` on the server span, and the
  `@telemetryBrowser` directive propagates the same value to the RUM SDK
  (via `data-session`), so a whole *visit* — not just one trace — is one
  key. The built-in default is a **cookieless**, daily-rotating salted hash
  (IP + UA + host + day), so a raw IP is never a durable grouping key.
- **Two overridable hooks** (the way to plug Cloudflare, a cookie, or your
  own logic):
  - `Telemetry::resolveSessionUsing($request)` — override the `session.id`
    (e.g. `CF-Ray`, a first-party cookie). Returns null → cookieless default.
  - `Telemetry::resolveClientGeoUsing($request)` — supply `client.geo.*`
    from edge headers (e.g. `CF-IPCountry`), no geo database required.
- `session.id` is now a default redaction safe-key (it is the OTel session
  identifier, a hash by construction — never the raw Laravel session id,
  which is only ever recorded, hashed, as `session.hash`).

## [0.1.0-alpha.10] - 2026-07-04

Prometheus metric names now carry unit suffixes.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Prometheus metric names now include the unit as a suffix**, per
  Prometheus/OpenMetrics convention: a `ms` metric renders as
  `<name>_milliseconds` and a `By` metric as `<name>_bytes` (the suffix
  precedes `_total`/`_bucket`/`_sum`/`_count`). Previously the unit lived
  only in the `# HELP` text, so e.g. `http_server_request_duration` is now
  `http_server_request_duration_milliseconds`. This is what the bundled
  dashboards and alerting rules already expected — their latency/duration/
  memory panels and rules now resolve against real series. **If you wrote
  your own PromQL against these metrics, add the unit suffix.** OTLP metric
  names are unaffected (units stay a separate field there).
- The bundled alerting rules (alpha.9) are updated to the suffixed names.

## [0.1.0-alpha.9] - 2026-07-04

Alerting rules, plus a log-channel boot-order fix.

### Added

- **Bundled alerting rules** (`resources/grafana/alerts/telemetry-alerts.yaml`)
  — a standard Prometheus rule file (loadable via `rule_files:`, importable
  into Grafana unified alerting) that fires on the same metrics the
  dashboards chart: request 5xx rate + p95 latency, exception spikes, queue
  failures + backlog, scheduled-task failures, outgoing-HTTP failures, and a
  pipeline self-check (export failing / no data). Per service + environment,
  thresholds tunable.

### Fixed

- **The `telemetry` log driver is now registered in `register()`, not
  `boot()`.** If anything resolved the `log` manager (and built a `stack`
  channel) before this provider booted, the telemetry sub-channel silently
  fell back to an emergency handler and no logs ever reached telemetry.
  Registering the driver earlier guarantees it exists before any channel is
  built.
- **The log handler resolves the telemetry manager lazily, per write.** A
  channel built and cached before `Telemetry::fake()` used to keep the
  original manager, so faked assertions silently missed log events.

## [0.1.0-alpha.8] - 2026-07-04

Source-map symbolication: browser stacks resolve to original source.

### Added

- **Source-map upload + symbolication.** An opt-in, **token-gated**
  `POST {sourcemaps.path}` endpoint (`TELEMETRY_SOURCEMAPS`,
  `TELEMETRY_SOURCEMAPS_TOKEN`) receives your build's `.map` files from CI,
  keyed by release, validated as v3, size-capped, and stored on a configured
  disk. Unlike the world-reachable span ingest, uploads come from CI — which
  *can* hold a secret — so this is bearer-token gated and secure by default
  (a token is required; it can never be left accidentally open).
- **`Support\Symbolicator`** — a self-contained source-map v3 resolver (a
  hand-rolled VLQ decoder, no ext, no library). `symbolicateStack($release,
  $stack)` parses Chrome/Firefox/Safari stack strings and resolves each
  minified frame back to original source/line/column/name, so browser error
  grouping and detail become as good as the backend's. Symbolication is a
  read-time concern — the raw stack is stored as-is; an issues UI resolves it
  on demand, so maps never have to be public. Fail-safe: a missing or bad map
  just leaves the frame minified.

## [0.1.0-alpha.7] - 2026-07-04

Turnkey browser RUM: a bundled, zero-build script + one Blade directive.

### Added

- **`@telemetryBrowser`** — a single Blade directive that emits the
  traceparent meta plus a bundled, dependency-free RUM script (served from
  your app, cached). It roots the browser trace on the server trace,
  records a `document.load` span, instruments `fetch` (propagating
  `traceparent` to same-origin calls so backend spans join the trace;
  cross-origin skipped to avoid CORS preflight), and captures uncaught JS
  errors as error spans. What it captures is configurable
  (`ingest.spans.browser.{fetch,errors,sample}`). Publish it to your own
  build with `vendor:publish --tag=telemetry-assets`. No npm, no build
  step — a full browser SDK remains a separate future package.

## [0.1.0-alpha.6] - 2026-07-04

End-to-end distributed tracing: an optional browser span ingest.

### Added

- **Browser / RUM span ingest** (`TELEMETRY_INGEST_SPANS`, off by default):
  an opt-in `POST {ingest.spans.path}` endpoint the frontend sends its own
  spans to (page load, fetch timings, JS errors). Combined with the
  existing incoming-`traceparent` continuation, browser and backend spans
  share one trace id — a single end-to-end waterfall. Protected by
  throttling, strict payload bounding (capped span count/attributes/name
  lengths, hex-id validation, timestamp clamping) and optional head
  sampling — never a bearer token, since a browser can't hold a secret.
  Every value passes the redaction engine; spans are stamped `browser`.
- `@telemetryTraceparent` Blade directive — renders a
  `<meta name="traceparent">` so the browser can parent its RUM spans to
  the current server trace.
- `Telemetry::ingestSpans()` — export externally-produced spans directly.

## [0.1.0-alpha.5] - 2026-07-04

Drop-in backend error tracking — structured, fingerprinted exception
records (the raw data for an issues view).

### Added

- **Structured exception records** for drop-in backend error tracking.
  Every `report()`ed exception (handled or not) now emits an OTLP log
  record (→ Loki, severity ERROR) with `exception.type`/`message`/`file`/
  `line`/`stacktrace`, the ambient context, and a **Sentry-style
  `exception.group` fingerprint** (class + throw site, `vendor/` skipped)
  so identical failures group into one issue instead of merging by class.
  Captured even out of a trace or when sampled away. Span exception
  events are enriched to match and deduplicated by exception identity
  (a failed job is recorded once, not twice). Opt-in `exception.source`
  (`instrument.exception_source`) attaches the code around the throw site.

## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- `Telemetry::resolveRouteUsing()` — supply the **logical route** for
  catch-all frameworks. A CMS's single `/{segments?}` template makes every
  page share one `http.route`, collapsing route tables and latency
  histograms into a single bucket. The resolver's (bounded) return value
  now replaces `http.route` on both the span attribute and the metric
  label, so the whole ecosystem — the UI route table, Grafana, TraceQL —
  groups by the logical route. The literal Laravel template is preserved
  as the `http.route.template` span attribute when overridden. This is the
  route counterpart to `nameRequestsUsing` (which shapes only the span
  name).

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-07-03

Dashboard fixes: the logs panels returned HTTP 400, and the suite gained
environment/host filters. Also makes the Prometheus scrape endpoint
self-identifying.

### Fixed

- Logs dashboards returned HTTP 400 — Loki rejects a stream selector that
  can match empty (`{service_name=~".*"}`). Template variables now use
  `.+` for their "All" value (valid in both Loki and Prometheus).

### Added

- Dashboard filters for **environment** and **host** across the whole
  suite: `$environment` (`deployment_environment_name`) separates the same
  service across prod/staging/…, and `$host` (`host_name`) breaks down the
  otherwise-aggregated fleet. Both thread through every metric and trace
  query; the overview gains a "Fleet" row (requests by environment, by
  host). The Requests dashboard's domain filter was renamed `$host` →
  `$domain` to free up `$host` for the machine/pod.
- The Prometheus scrape endpoint now stamps the resource identity
  (`service_name`, `service_namespace`, `deployment_environment_name`,
  `host_name`) onto every series — so a single Prometheus scraping many
  apps (or many hosts) can tell them apart, matching what OTLP push
  carries. Churny attrs (deploy id, version) are left off.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-07-03

Env-var naming standardization and first-class OTLP auth. Breaking vs
alpha.1 (expected during alpha) — update `.env` keys per below.

### Added

- **`TELEMETRY_OTLP_TOKEN`** — first-class bearer token for an auth-gated
  OTLP endpoint (e.g. a shared collector), sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. No more hand-wiring the `otlp.headers`
  array. Arbitrary headers can also come from the OTel-standard
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` (`k1=v1,k2=v2`).

### Changed

- **Env vars standardized**: every variable is now `TELEMETRY_`-prefixed
  and mirrors its config path. Renames:
  `TELEMETRY_ENVIRONMENT` → `TELEMETRY_SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT`,
  `TELEMETRY_DEPLOYMENT` → `TELEMETRY_SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT`,
  `TELEMETRY_TRACE_DETAILS` → `TELEMETRY_TRACES_DETAILS`,
  `TELEMETRY_TRACE_RESPONSE_HEADER` → `TELEMETRY_TRACES_RESPONSE_HEADER`,
  `TELEMETRY_SLOW_REQUEST_MS` → `TELEMETRY_TRACES_SLOW_REQUEST_MS`,
  `TELEMETRY_SLOW_SPAN_MS` → `TELEMETRY_TRACES_SLOW_SPAN_MS`,
  `TELEMETRY_SPOOL_{CONNECTION,KEY,MAX_ITEMS}` → `TELEMETRY_OTLP_SPOOL_*`,
  `TELEMETRY_QUERIES_MIN_DURATION` → `TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENT_QUERIES_MIN_DURATION`.
  The OTLP endpoint's primary variable is now `TELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
- OpenTelemetry-standard variables are honored as fallbacks for interop —
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`,
  `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (and the already-supported `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`).
  `TELEMETRY_*` wins when both are set.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-03

First public release. **Alpha** — the public API may still change before the
1.0 stability guarantee. Everything below is new in this release.

### Added

#### Reliability & correctness

- **Octane**: the gate/policy hook was bound once to the boot-time Gate
  instance, which Octane flushes per request — so `authorization.checks`
  silently died after the first request on every worker. Now re-armed
  via a container `afterResolving` callback (WeakMap-guarded against
  double-counting). Queue instrumentation removed from the request/tick
  reset list — a job's lifecycle is bounded by its own events, not the
  HTTP boundary.
- **Redaction**: a sensitive key holding a non-string value (an int PIN,
  an OTP token, a bool) escaped key-based redaction — the string guard
  ran before the key check. Key redaction now applies regardless of
  value type.
- **Spool**: on a partial ship failure (traces delivered, logs down) the
  whole chunk was requeued, re-shipping the delivered traces as
  duplicates. Now per-signal: only the failed signal requeues.
  Permanently rejected batches (4xx) are dropped instead of wedging the
  spool behind a head-of-line block. Unencodable entries are skipped
  rather than silently poisoning the list.
- **Cardinality**: `notifications.sent` used the FQCN while
  `notifications.failed` used the basename — unified to the basename.
  `bus.batches` dropped its `name` label (apps name batches with ids —
  unbounded). Explicit `redis_ignore_connections` is now unioned with
  the telemetry store/spool connections instead of replacing them, so
  the self-instrumentation guarantee holds.

#### Performance

- Octane hardening (Swoole/RoadRunner/FrankenPHP): half-open
  instrumentation state (in-flight HTTP calls, open transactions,
  pending cache reads) is now flushed on the `RequestReceived`/
  `TickReceived` boundary via the new `ManagesRequestState` contract —
  previously a request that died mid-operation could leak worker memory
  and mis-parent the next request's spans across the long-lived worker.
- OTLP spool + flush daemon for high traffic
  (`TELEMETRY_OTLP_SPOOL=true` + `telemetry:flush --daemon`): requests
  push serialized spans/events to a capped Redis list (one RPUSH, no
  HTTP at terminate); the daemon ships merged batches every second and
  metrics every 15 s. Endpoint-down chunks are requeued, daemon-down
  caps at drop-oldest, SIGTERM drains before exit. Cron mode drains the
  spool once per run.
- Write buffering (`buffer_writes`, default on): metric writes aggregate
  in memory and flush once at request/job terminate — repeated increments
  cost one store command, histogram observations flush as pre-aggregated
  buckets. `MetricStore` gained `mergeHistogram()` for this.

#### Observability UX

- Resource detection (`resource_detection`, default on): every signal
  now carries where it ran — `container.id`/`container.runtime` from
  cgroups (via cboxdk/system-metrics), `k8s.pod.name`,
  `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.node.name`, `cloud.region` from downward-API
  env vars, and anything in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` (the OTel
  standard). Config `service.*` stays authoritative. Fills the biggest
  gap for containerized fleets, where `host.name` is a random pod hash.
- Self-observability (`self_metrics`, default on): the package reports
  on itself — `telemetry.export.{duration,count,rejected}`,
  `telemetry.export.circuit_open` (when OTLP is used) and
  `telemetry.spool.depth` (when the spool is enabled). Recorded inline on
  the export path (no feedback loop). New "Telemetry health" row on the
  System dashboard — alert on a stuck circuit or a backing-up spool.
- Broader core-event coverage: authentication lifecycle
  (`auth.events{event,guard}` — login/logout/failed/lockout/…, the
  credential-attack signal), DB transaction spans
  (`db.transaction`, nested via savepoints, + `db.transactions.rolled_back`),
  Eloquent (`model.hydrations` N+1 tally, `models.events{model,event}`,
  `models.pruned`), job batches (`bus.batches{event,name}`), Redis
  command spans (`instrument.redis`, off by default — key only, never
  values, telemetry's own connections auto-ignored), notification
  failures (`notifications.failed`), cache flushes, queue timeouts
  (`queue.jobs.timed_out`) and depth (`queue.size` from queue:monitor),
  and PHP deprecations (`php.deprecations`, via the log channel).
- Deploys are first-class: `service.deployment` auto-detects the git
  sha from `.git/HEAD` when unset (no exec), `telemetry:deploy` emits
  an `app.deployment` marker event from the deploy pipeline, and every
  bundled dashboard renders deploys as annotation lines. Resource
  attributes gained `process.runtime.name/version` and
  `laravel.version`.
- Gate/policy instrumentation (`instrument.gates`, default on):
  `authorization.checks{ability, result}` counter plus
  `gate.check.count`/`gate.denied.count` tallies on the request root
  span — authorization denials become visible without any code changes.
- View render spans (`instrument.views`, default on): every Blade/PHP
  view, partial and component in its own span — real durations, natural
  nesting via engine decoration (rendering always proceeds if telemetry
  fails; unknown engine methods forward). Detail-marked so tail mode
  trims healthy traces; `view.render.count` tally on the root span
  regardless.
- Session dimension (`instrument.session`, default on): `session.driver`
  + `session.hash` (truncated sha256 — never the raw id, it is a
  credential) on request root spans. One TraceQL query follows a whole
  visitor journey; the Users dashboard gained a session-journey panel.
  The redaction engine gained `safe_keys` so these exact keys escape
  key-based redaction while patterns still apply.
- Extension hooks for packages building on top (CMS integrations):
  `nameRequestsUsing()` names root spans behind catch-all routes (an
  explicit `updateName()` is never clobbered by terminate),
  `enrichRequestsUsing()` adds root-span attributes with the final
  response in hand, and `classifyCacheKeysUsing()` groups or drops
  cache keys (`key_group` label / `cache.key.group` attribute) with
  `instrument.cache_ignore_stores` for whole stores.
- The `X-Trace-Id` header is skipped on publicly cacheable responses
  (`Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage`) — a CDN or static page cache
  must never replay one stale trace id to every visitor.
- Multi-guard user attribution: request spans carry `enduser.type` (the
  model: user/admin/reseller) and `enduser.guard` alongside `enduser.id`,
  so admin #7 and user #7 are distinct identities.
  `resolveUserUsing()` now receives the guard as a second argument.
  Login/Logout events are remembered within the request, so the login
  POST itself and logout requests get user attribution too.
- Redaction engine (`telemetry.redaction`): every span attribute, span
  event (exception messages), telemetry event and log record (message +
  context) passes one choke point at flush — key-segment matching (`password`, `api_key`, …) replaces
  whole values, regex patterns scrub embedded secrets (JWTs,
  Bearer/Basic credentials, url userinfo), and
  `Telemetry::redactUsing()` adds a custom last pass.
- Request spans carry the full connection picture: `server.address` /
  `server.port` (the domain — multi-domain and wildcard apps are
  filterable), `client.address`, `user_agent.original`,
  `network.protocol.version`, redacted `url.query`, and allowlisted
  request/response headers (credentials denylisted, always). Metrics gain
  a `server.address` label (route domain patterns keep wildcard-tenant
  cardinality bounded; `instrument.host_label`); the Requests dashboard
  gained a domain filter + rate-by-domain panel.
- The trace id as a support reference: `X-Trace-Id` on every response
  (`traces.response_header`), `trace_id` published into Laravel `Context`
  at trace start — Sentry (≥ 4.x), Flare and all log channels pick it up
  automatically — plus an explicit Sentry scope tag
  (`traces.share_context`). Requests dashboard gained a trace-id lookup
  panel and a 4xx errors section.
- Tail detail retention (`traces.details.mode=tail`): cache/query detail
  spans are kept only for traces with errors, slow requests or a slow
  query — healthy fast traces ship a lean skeleton with tallies while
  counters/histograms flow unconditionally. Decided at flush with the
  whole trace in memory; buffer-cap flushes always keep details.
- Worker memory self-reporting: `worker.memory.{php,rss}{queue,pid}`
  gauges set after every job — the memory-leak curve, no daemon needed.
- `telemetry:monitor` (node_exporter analog, optional): host CPU (between-
  tick delta), memory, load, disk, network + foreign processes (Reverb,
  Horizon) by pgrep pattern — `--once` for cron mode or a supervisor
  daemon. System provider gained filesystem + network observable gauges.
- Cache timeline spans (`instrument.cache_spans`): every cache
  hit/miss/write/forget as a span with key, store and duration measured
  via Laravel's before/after cache events — the Nightwatch-style
  request timeline; root spans carry cache.event.count/time_ms tallies.
- Outgoing HTTP auto-instrumentation: client spans (host + path, never
  the query string) with a duration histogram by host/method/status and
  a connection-failure counter.
- Queue dispatch tracking: `queue.jobs.dispatched` counter and
  `queue.job.wait_time` histogram (dispatch -> attempt lag) with
  `messaging.wait_time_ms` on consumer spans.
- Reported-exception tracking: `exceptions.reported{exception}` counter
  via the exception handler's reportable hook — HANDLED report()s
  included — plus a non-failing span event on the active span.
- Command metrics (`command.duration`, `commands.{completed,failed}`)
  alongside command spans.
- Per-request query tallies on the root span (`db.query.count`,
  `db.query.time_ms`) via a generic per-trace stat mechanism.
- `Telemetry::resolveUserUsing()` opt-in for richer user attribution
  (name/username) beyond the default PII-free `enduser.id`.
- `deployment.id` resource attribute from `TELEMETRY_DEPLOYMENT`.

- Error spans escape sampling (`traces.always_sample_errors`) — sampled
  apps still export every failing span.
- Per-route sampling middleware: `Sample::rate(0.01)` /
  `Sample::always()` / `Sample::never()`; the re-decision covers the
  active trace including the open request span, and propagates.
- Mail and notification instrumentation (client spans + counters) and
  opt-in cache.operations counters (hit/miss/write/forget, no key
  labels).
- Backdated `laravel.bootstrap` span + `laravel.bootstrap_ms` attribute
  from `LARAVEL_START`, so framework boot shows in the waterfall.

- Per-span resource attribution: every sampled span carries its own
  `php.cpu.time_ms` and `php.memory.delta_bytes`, so trace waterfalls
  show where CPU/memory went (backdated query spans excluded).
- Bundled Grafana dashboard suite: thirteen service-scoped dashboards
  mirroring an APM sidebar (Overview, Requests, Jobs, Commands,
  Scheduled Tasks, Exceptions, Queries, Cache, Outgoing, Mail &
  Notifications, System, Users, Logs) — linked as top-bar tabs with
  shared time/filters, semantic colors, drill-down field links, worker
  leak curves and queue wait-time panels. `telemetry:dashboards`
  imports or exports them.

- Per-request/job/task resource attribution: `php.memory.peak_bytes` and
  `php.cpu.time_ms` span attributes plus memory/CPU histograms
  (getrusage + memory_reset_peak_usage — worker-safe). With
  `cboxdk/system-metrics` installed, spans also carry the real process
  footprint: `process.memory.rss_peak_bytes` and
  `process.cpu.utilization` via a ProcessMetrics tracker per unit of
  work. Opt out via `instrument.resources`.
- Scheduled task monitoring: spans with cron/timezone/overlap attributes,
  `schedule.task.duration` histogram and
  `schedule.tasks.{processed,failed,skipped}` counters — including the
  skipped outcome; background tasks excluded to avoid double collection;
  per-task state isolation in `schedule:run`.
- OTLP serialization survives invalid UTF-8 (substitution instead of
  dropping the batch) and request spans carry
  `http.request.body.size`/`http.response.body.size`.

- `Telemetry::context([...])`: custom dimensions (team, tenant, plan)
  merged into every span, event and log record — inherited by dispatched
  jobs along with `messaging.origin.name` (the dispatch origin).
- `Telemetry::labelRequestsUsing()`: bounded extra labels on the request
  duration histogram — p95/p99 per plan/team in PromQL.

- Request spans carry `enduser.id` (authenticated user id, opt-out via
  `instrument.user`) for per-user trace filtering.
- Queue metric label renamed `job` -> `job.name` (`job_name` in
  Prometheus) — a bare `job` label collides with Prometheus' reserved
  scrape-job label and was silently overwritten by collectors.

#### Foundations & hardening

- Redis store: steady-state writes are now a single atomic command
  (Redis Cluster-safe, ~5x fewer round trips); metadata refreshes per
  deploy; `__since` field feeds OTLP cumulative start timestamps.
- Event buffer capped (`events.max_buffer`) — long-running workers can't
  grow memory unbounded.
- Registry rejects mixing push and observable gauges under one name;
  the Prometheus renderer additionally deduplicates same-name families
  so a collision can never fail the whole scrape.
- Queue instrumentation covers released-for-retry attempts
  (`queue.jobs.released`) and keeps job spans on a stack so nested sync
  dispatches can't leak the outer span.
- OTLP: per-process circuit breaker after retryable failures (honours
  Retry-After), gzip request compression, explicit TLS verification,
  NAN/INF-safe serialization, `startTimeUnixNano` on cumulative points.
- Query spans skip unsampled traces and support a
  `queries_min_duration` noise floor.
- `traces.trust_incoming_sampling` — keep trace-id correlation on public
  edges while deciding sampling locally.
- New `telemetry:doctor` command: store round trip, exporter
  reachability, config warnings (flags an unprotected scrape endpoint).

- Counters, push/observable gauges and histograms over a shared metric
  store (Redis, APCu, array drivers).
- Tracing with W3C trace context: automatic request, queue job, DB query
  and Artisan command spans; full traceparent propagation into queued jobs.
- Structured events exported as trace-correlated OTLP log records.
- Prometheus scrape endpoints (multiple, named, filterable, IP-guarded).
- Direct OTLP/HTTP JSON export (traces, metrics, logs) — no SDK, no
  collector required.
- `telemetry:flush` command for scheduled OTLP metric export.
- `TelemetryProvider` contract + `Telemetry::contributes()` for decoupled
  package telemetry; built-in `cboxdk/system-metrics` provider.
- `Telemetry::fake()` with metric, span and event assertions (positive and
  negative).
- Push gauges adjust atomically with `increment()`/`decrement()` for
  up-and-down values (in-flight jobs, active connections).
- `Http::withTraceparent()` macro for opt-in outbound trace propagation.
- `telemetry` log channel: Laravel logs exported as trace-correlated OTLP
  log records with Monolog severity mapping and feedback-loop protection.
- `php artisan about` section showing store, exporters, endpoints and
  sample rate.
- AI surface: Laravel Boost package guidelines (`.ai/guidelines/`),
  `llms.txt` documentation index, an `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` agent guide
  for contributors, and copy-paste **Agent prompt** blocks in the docs
  (install, instrument-my-app, log channel, package provider, Grafana).
