# Error tracking & the support flow

The trace id is the universal reference that ties an error report, a
support case and the full technical context (the Tempo waterfall)
together. The package publishes it everywhere automatically.

## What happens out of the box

At trace start (request, job, scheduled task) the package:

1. Adds `trace_id` to **Laravel's `Context` facade** — picked up
   automatically by sentry-laravel (≥ 4.x), Spatie Flare/Ignition and
   every log channel.
2. Sets an explicit **Sentry scope tag** (`trace_id`) when the Sentry SDK
   is installed — visible on the issue page even on older SDK versions.
3. Exposes **`X-Trace-Id` on every response**
   (`traces.response_header`, disable with null) — except publicly
   cacheable ones (`Cache-Control: public`/`s-maxage`), where a CDN or
   page cache would replay one stale id to every visitor.

Error spans always export — even from sampled-down traces
(`always_sample_errors`) — so the id on a Sentry issue reliably resolves
to a trace.

## Flow: Sentry issue → trace

The issue carries the `trace_id` tag (and the Laravel Context block).
Paste it into the **trace lookup** on the bundled Requests dashboard, or
open Grafana Explore → Tempo → the id. You land on the exact waterfall:
queries, cache ops, the queued job, memory/CPU, the user.

Optional deep link: in Sentry → Settings → Issue Links (or a simple
saved bookmark), template
`https://grafana.example.com/explore?schemaVersion=1&panes={"t":{"datasource":"tempo","queries":[{"query":"{{ tag.trace_id }}"}]}}`.

## Flow: support case → trace

Show the id to the user on your error page — “we've been notified;
quote this reference id if you contact support”:

```blade
{{-- resources/views/errors/500.blade.php --}}
<p>We've been notified automatically. If you contact support about
   this problem, quote this reference id:</p>
@if ($traceId = Cbox\Telemetry\Facades\Telemetry::traceId())
    <code>{{ $traceId }}</code>
@endif
```

`Telemetry::traceId()` works during error rendering — the request span
is still active. API consumers get the same id from the `X-Trace-Id`
response header. Support pastes the id into the Requests dashboard's
trace lookup and sees exactly what that user hit.

## Flow: trace → error tracker

Error spans carry `exception.type` and `exception.message` as span
events, and `exceptions.reported{exception}` counts every `report()` —
from a spike in the Exceptions dashboard, the class name + time window
finds the Sentry issue.

## Flare / other trackers

Anything that snapshots Laravel `Context` gets `trace_id` for free.
For trackers that don't, add it manually where you configure them:

```php
Flare::context('trace_id', Telemetry::traceId());
// Bugsnag::registerCallback(fn ($report) => $report->setMetaData([
//     'telemetry' => ['trace_id' => Telemetry::traceId()],
// ]));
```

Disable all automatic publishing with
`TELEMETRY_TRACES_SHARE_CONTEXT=false`.

## Exceptions as structured records (drop-in error tracking)

Every `report()`ed exception — handled or not — becomes a **structured
error record** exported as an OTLP log (→ Loki), alongside the
`exceptions.reported` counter and the span event in the trace waterfall.
Each record carries:

- `exception.type`, `exception.message`
- `exception.file`, `exception.line`, `exception.stacktrace`
- **`exception.group`** — a Sentry-style fingerprint (exception class +
  the throw site, `vendor/` frames skipped) so identical failures group
  into one *issue* instead of merging by class. Machine-independent, so a
  fingerprint is stable across hosts and deploys.
- `user.id` — the authenticated user's id (guests omit it), so an
  issues UI can say "affects N users" per group. Resolved fail-safe: an
  unbootable auth container mid-failure never breaks the record.
- the ambient [context](../core-concepts/traces.md#custom-dimensions-context)
  (team, tenant, user, trace id).
- optionally `exception.source` — the code around the throw site — when
  `instrument.exception_source` is on.

Because it's an OTLP log record (not just a span event), an exception is
captured **even out of a trace** (early boot, some CLI) or when the trace
is sampled away. This is the raw data an issues UI groups by
`exception.group` (first/last seen, count, sample stacktrace, drill to
the trace). The counter stays class-scoped for bounded rate/alerting;
the fingerprint lives on the record, never as a metric label.

One `report()` produces exactly **one** of these records. Laravel's own
trailing default-logger pass for the same throwable is skipped by the
telemetry log channel (identity-based, one-shot — see
[logs: exception log deduplication](../core-concepts/logs.md#exception-log-deduplication)),
so wiring the channel into `LOG_STACK` does not double-report.
